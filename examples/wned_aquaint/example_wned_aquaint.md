   Stolen painting in  __[New Zealand](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Zealand)__    recovered, one man arrested

 A 19th-century painting worth U.S. dlrs 1 million stolen from  __[Auckland Art Gallery](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Auckland_Art_Gallery)__    nine days ago has been recovered, police said Monday. 

 Senior Sgt. Gary Allcock said he understood that one person had been arrested over the theft of the 1874 oil, "Still on Top,'' by French-born artist  __[Jacques-Joseph (James) Tissot](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Tissot)__   , one of New Zealand's most expensive and popular European works. 

 He said details would be disclosed later. 

 The painting valued at up to U.S. dlrs 1 million was stolen Aug. 9 by a man armed with a  __[shotgun](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shotgun)__    in a daring robbery at the  __[Auckland](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Auckland)__    Art Gallery. 

 The man, clad in black and wearing a motorcycle helmet, dark visor and gloves, burst through the main door with a sawed-off shotgun and a  __[crowbar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crowbar_(tool))__   . 

 Museum official Kate Darrow said the man ran through the Grey Gallery waving a  __[firearm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Firearm)__    and yelling "get down,'' and "keep back'' to staff and patrons. 

 She said the man appeared to know where he was going and went to the Lower Wellesley Gallery, where the painting was displayed. 

 The gunman grabbed the painting off the wall and dropped it on the ground. He then used the crowbar to remove the canvas from the frame and take it off the backing board. 

 The robber left through the main entrance and skirted behind the gallery into  __[Albert Park](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albert_Park,_Auckland)__

  __[Shoko Asahara](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shoko_Asahara)__   , the leader of the  __[Aum Shinri Kyo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aum_Shinrikyo)__    cult, is on trial on 17 charges in the March 20, 1995  __[sarin attack](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sarin_gas_attack_on_the_Tokyo_subway)__    that killed 12 people and sickened thousands. 

 Other cult leaders have also been charged in the  __[gassing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gas_chamber)__    as well as in other slayings. 

 Osamu Watanabe, Asahara's chief  __[defense](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defense_(legal))__    lawyer, said the trial should not be allowed to go on. 

 "We must wonder why such abnormal and unfair proceedings are tolerated. The court has been negligent,'' Watanabe told the  __[Tokyo District Court](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tokyo_District_Court)__   . 

 The prosecutors say Asahara, accused of masterminding the subway gassing, decided on the attack on March 18, 1995 while riding in a car with his followers.

   Norwegian company moves ahead with clean power plant

 The  __[Norsk Hydro ASA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norsk_Hydro)__    concern announced plans Friday to build a  __[hydrogen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydrogen)__   -burning  __[power plant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Power_station)__    that it says will produce  __[electricity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electricity)__    with virtually no climate-damaging  __[emissions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Air_pollution)__   . 

 The 51-percent  __[state-owned company](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Government-owned_corporation)__    notified the  __[Norwegian Water Resources and Energy Directorate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norwegian_Water_Resources_and_Energy_Directorate)__    of plans to build the plant, to be called HydroKraft, pending approval by government agencies. 

 The company said if it receives the proper approvals in 1999, construction of the plant would be completed during 2002 and production startup would occur in early 2003. 

 Earlier this year, the company announced a new technology that would allow it to use clean-burning hydrogen to generate electricity. The hydrogen for the plant would be extracted from  __[natural gas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_gas)__   . 

 Norsk Hydro, a major  __[petroleum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Petroleum)__    producer, now says studies have shown the proposal to be economically viable. It also said the plant's  __[carbon dioxide](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon_dioxide)__    emissions would be 90 percent lower than plants using natural gas. 

  __[Norway](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norway)__    is the world's second-largest oil exporter, and also produces vast amounts of natural gas from its offshore fields. Virtually all of the country's electricity now comes from  __[hydroelectric plants](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydroelectricity)__   . 

 Under the company's plans, natural gas, air and water would be mixed to produce hydrogen,  __[nitrogen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nitrogen)__    and carbon dioxide. 

 Norsk Hydro wants to build the plant at Karmoey, an island about 500 kilometers (300 miles) west of  __[Oslo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oslo)__

   Portugal and Spain reach agreement on common water supplies

  __[Portugal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portugal)__    and  __[Spain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spain)__    on Monday reached an agreement over shared  __[water resources](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Water_resources)__    on the  __[Iberian peninsula](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iberian_Peninsula)__   , wrapping up a two-day summit that both premiers called historic. 

 "It is an ambitious, modern, wide-ranging and efficient agreement,'' Portugal's  __[Prime Minister](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_minister)__     __[Antonio Guterres](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/António_Guterres)__    said at the end of the summit in Albufeira, about 200 kilometers (125 miles) south of  __[Lisbon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lisbon)__   . 

 Both governments worked out a shared management plan to monitor water  __[volume](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volume)__    in the rivers which supply both countries. 

 Spanish Premier  __[Jose Maria Aznar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/José_María_Aznar)__    said the agreement reflected "an exceptional moment'' of relations between the two Iberian countries. 

  __[Water supply](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Water_supply)__    on the southwest European peninsula was one of the few sticking points between the two countries, which have strong trade links and close political ties. 

 Spanish plans to develop  __[hydroelectric](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydroelectricity)__    projects on its side of the border have been a constant threat to Portugal's supply, which comes mainly from rivers with sources in the neighboring country. 

 Both governments also reiterated their decision jointly to campaign for continued development funds provided by wealthier  __[European Union](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Union)__    nations. 

 Cabinet Members also agreed to build new road and railway links between the two countries. 

 The Albufeira summit also produced a plan to increase cooperation between police at the border, in order to curb  __[illegal immigration](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Illegal_immigration)__    and  __[drug trafficking](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Illegal_drug_trade)__

   Vietnam's prime minister demands improvements by state  __[monopoly](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monopoly)__   

  __[Prime Minister](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_minister)__     __[Phan Van Khai](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phan_Văn_Khải)__    has taken the state  __[electricity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electricity)__    monopoly to task for abuse of power and excessive  __[bureaucracy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bureaucracy)__    while accusing it of overcharging, the newspaper Dau Tu (Investment) reported Thursday. 

 In a blunt assessment, he ordered Electricity of  __[Vietnam](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vietnam)__    to help cut waste that is driving up costs and could spark public discontent. EVN must work out corrective measures based on his instructions, and individual leaders have to do  __[self-criticisms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-criticism)__   . 

 Khai said the utility has plenty of problems, particularly in the  __[tender](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tender)__    process and  __[project accounting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Project_accounting)__   , that have led to complaints and affect Vietnam's reputation with foreign investors. 

 In March, former President  __[Le Duc Anh](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Le_Duc_Anh)__   , in an article for the Army newspaper, criticized irregularities in the bidding process for the country's largest thermal electric plant. 

 Local media have reported that the company has overblown the costs for construction and repair work on a number of projects to justify overcharging for electricity. 

 Vietnam is chronically short of power, and several projects to raise its output are bogged down in bureaucracy. 

 EVN imposed  __[rotating power cuts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Power_outage)__    earlier this year as the worst  __[drought](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drought)__    in a century dropped water levels to critical levels at the  __[reservoir](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reservoir)__   s that feed key  __[hydroelectric](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydroelectricity)__

 Mohammed Mehdi Saleh and his seven-member  __[delegation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delegation)__    traveled by land and crossed into Iran at the Khosrawi border point in the western  __[Kermanshah province](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kermanshah_Province)__   , the official news agency said.

 This is the second consecutive year that Iraq is attending the  __[Tehran](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tehran)__    International Trade Fair, and points at the need for the two neighbors to do business despite their traditional animosity. 

 Iran and Iraq fought an  __[eight-year war](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iran–Iraq_War)__    which ended with a  __[U.N.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations)__   -brokered cease-fire.

 The agreement was reached following a week of talks in  __[Baghdad](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baghdad)__    between senior Iraqi officials and a visiting Iranian delegation headed by Abdullah al-Najafi, head of Iran's POW commission, the official  __[Iraqi News Agency](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Iraqi_News_Agency)__    reported Wednesday. 

 But the agency gave no further details and al-Najafi, who left Baghdad on Wednesday, declined to comment. 

 Al-Najafi arrived in Baghdad last week with a list of thousands of Iranian POWs  __[Tehran](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tehran)__    claims are still held by Iraq. 

 Iraq has long maintained that it has released all Iranian prisoners and was reportedly angered by the new list. 

 In April, Iran released 5,584 Iraqi POWs and Iraq freed three POWs and 316 Iranians it classified as civil law detainees. 

 It was the largest  __[repatriation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Repatriation)__    of Iranian and Iraqi POWs since 1990, said the  __[International Committee of the Red Cross](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Committee_of_the_Red_Cross)__   , which supervised the swap.

 According to him, it was the ministry's policy now that the  __[minister](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minister_(government))__   , deputy minister, parliamentary secretary, director-general and other senior ministry officials had to visit the PPRT projects to see what was happening to the allocation given by the Government. 

 Annuar said this after visiting a  __[mussel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mussel)__    rearing project in Kuala  __[Lukut](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lukut)__    today as part of his day-long visit to several PPRT projects in  __[Negri Sembilan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Negeri_Sembilan)__   .

 Seeking to shift some domestic travel from  __[planes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fixed-wing_aircraft)__    to  __[trains](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Train)__   ,  __[Germany](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germany)__   's flag carrier,  __[Lufthansa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lufthansa)__   , and the German railway signed a letter of intent Monday to work on coordinating services and schedules. 

 The goal is to make it easier to travel by train to Lufthansa's  __[main hub](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airline_hub)__    in  __[Frankfurt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frankfurt)__   , instead of flying there. Starting in 2001, Lufthansa boss Juergen Weber hopes to eliminate such short hops _ between Frankfurt and  __[Cologne](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cologne)__   , for example _ thus freeing up takeoff and  __[landing slots](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Landing_slot)__    for more lucrative international flights. 

 As part of the Lufthansa- __[Deutsche Bahn](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deutsche_Bahn)__    deal, passengers could check their luggage through at the train station for the Lufthansa flight they will catch at Frankfurt. 

 The service is already in place at Saarbruecken, although travelers must drop their bags off the day before. Starting in September, the service will be extended to five other cities: Duesseldorf, Cologne,  __[Bonn](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bonn)__   ,  __[Wuerzburg](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Würzburg)__    and Nuremberg.

    __[Swiss](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Switzerland)__    government eyes shutting down nuclear power plants

 The Swiss government Thursday announced that it is planning the country's eventual exit from  __[nuclear power](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_power)__   , saying it wants to support instead  __[hydroelectric plants](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydroelectricity)__   . 

 But  __[environmental campaigners](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Environmentalism)__    criticized the lack of a timeframe for closing the country's  __[four nuclear power plants](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_power_in_Switzerland)__   . 

 Government officials will work with representatives of the  __[power industry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_power_industry)__   , environmental groups and local governments to discuss a timetable and removal of  __[nuclear waste](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radioactive_waste)__   , a government statement said. It is unrealistic to build more  __[power stations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Power_station)__    because of environmental concerns, the government has said. 

 Should the discussions between concerned parties fail to produce an agreed timetable, the federal  __[cabinet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cabinet_(government))__    will make the decision, said the statement. 

 "We have set out on a new course,'' said Federal Energy Minister  __[Moritz Leuenberger](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moritz_Leuenberger)__   . "Details have yet to be decided.'' 

 In a related move, the federal cabinet ordered energy officials to draw up a discussion paper on changing laws governing the domestic  __[electricity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electricity)__    market. 

 The government envisages the creation of a national company to own the power  __[infrastructure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infrastructure)__   . 

 A timeframe for carrying out  __[liberalization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liberalization)__    of the electricity market itself remains to be determined, the cabinet said.

   Prosecutor: Botha may still stand trial

 A  __[prosecutor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prosecutor)__    on Friday left open the possibility that former apartheid President  __[P.W. Botha](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/P._W._Botha)__    would be put on trial for abuses committed during  __[white rule](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dominant_minority)__   . 

 Prosecutor Jan D'Oliveira said he currently has insufficient evidence to prosecute Botha, but that information collected by the  __[Truth and Reconciliation Commission (South Africa)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Truth_and_Reconciliation_Commission_(South_Africa))__   , which investigated apartheid-era abuses, still must be evaluated to ascertain whether charges would ultimately be brought. 

 Last month, the Truth Comission issued a landmark report on its findings. It said Botha had ordered the 1987 bombing of the  __[African National Congress](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/African_National_Congress)__   ' London headquarters and the 1988 bombing of a  __[Johannesburg](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Johannesburg)__    building housing an anti-apartheid group. 

 When Botha was head of state in the 1980s, thousands of people were detained without trial. Many were tortured and others killed. 

 The commission can grant  __[amnesty](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amnesty)__    to those who fully confess to politically motivated abuses committed during apartheid. Botha has said he has nothing to confess and has not sought amnesty. 

 Earlier this year, Botha was convicted of  __[contempt of court](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contempt_of_court)__    for refusing to testify before the commission. He was handed a suspended one-year jail sentence and a 10,000  __[rand](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_African_rand)__

   German zoo hopes court will allow it to accept baby elephants

 The  __[Dresden](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dresden)__     __[Zoo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zoo)__    went to court Tuesday to challenge  __[Environment Minister Juergen Trittin's](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jürgen_Trittin)__    order forbidding the import of four baby  __[elephants](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elephant)__    taken from the wild in  __[Africa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Africa)__    and abused. 

 Zoo director Hubert Luecker said the complaint was filed with an administrative court in  __[Cologne](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cologne)__   . 

 The elephants, which were to be sent this month to the Dresden and  __[Erfurt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erfurt)__    zoos in eastern  __[Germany](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germany)__   , were part of a group of 30 young elephants captured in August from herds in  __[Botswana](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Botswana)__    and taken to a  __[South African](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Africa)__    farm. 

 A South African judge ruled early this month that the animals had been abused and deprived of water at the farm. He granted temporary custody to the  __[National Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Humane_Society)__   . 

 But while the judge approved the export of four baby elephants to Germany and three to  __[Switzerland](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Switzerland)__   , Trittin last week said Germany would protest the abuse of animals by not accepting them in its zoos. 

 Others argue the elephants may face a worse fate if they don't come to Germany. 

 Norbert Otto, a federal lawmaker from Erfurt, demanded in  __[parliament](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bundestag)__    Tuesday that Trittin take steps to prevent the animals from being  __[put to sleep](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Animal_euthanasia)__    in South Africa.

   Interpol needs to revamp  __[strategy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strategy)__    to keep abreast of crime

  __[Interpol](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interpol)__    must modernize if it wants to effectively fight increasingly sophisticated  __[crime syndicates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organized_crime)__    in the next century, the police organization's president said Thursday. 

 The criminal environment has changed at a "much greater pace'' than Interpol, Toshinori Kanemoto told the opening session of the 67th general assembly of the International Criminal Police Organization. 

 A failure to modernize Interpol could mean the organization "risks being displaced against a backdrop of international  __[organized crime](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organized_crime)__   ,'' he said. 

 Kanemoto said a new Interpol strategy will be discussed at the six-day assembly and, if adopted, would be put into effect next January. 

 The former Japanese police official said the assembly also will discuss  __[terrorism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terrorism)__   , which he called one of the "new forms of criminality,'' as well as the  __[illegal drug trade](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Illegal_drug_trade)__    and  __[money laundering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Money_laundering)__   . 

 With crime becoming increasingly sophisticated, Kanemoto said, it has become harder for police officials to gather  __[evidence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evidence)__    for prosecution. He said these new challenges require increased cooperation, particularly through Interpol. 

 The police officials are expected to discuss a  __[strategic development plan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strategic_planning)__

   International police seek to stymie  __[illegal art traffic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Art_theft)__   king

 Police officers from 23 countries met in  __[Budapest](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Budapest)__    to seek more efficient ways to combat  __[illegal traffic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smuggling)__    in art treasures, a police official said Thursday. 

 Held under the auspices of  __[Interpol](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interpol)__   , the  __[International Police](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations_Police)__    Organization, the three-day closed meeting allowed the officers to make personal contact and to help their  __[East European](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eastern_Europe)__    counterparts catch up. 

 "We have a five-member team working on illegal art traffic, and the group was set up only this April, while  __[France](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/France)__    has over 30 policemen in the same detail and with many years of experience,''  __[Hungarian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hungarian_people)__    police Col. Tamas Simon said. 

 Illegal art traffic is a growth industry. 

 In 1990, the year after  __[communism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Communism)__    collapsed, there were 702 registered cases in Hungary, and the total value of the stolen treasures was 71 million  __[forints](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hungarian_forint)__    (dlrs 340,000 in present terms). 

 In 1993, there were in 1996, 1,025 cases involving 430 million forints (dlrs two million) worth of stolen treasures. 

 "This is a special area of police work as stolen art may not appear for 30 years on the market,'' said Jean Pierre Jouanny, director of the French national bureau of Interpol. 

 Hungary is largely a transit country for stolen art, with the line of traffic moving from east to west. 

 Work is underway in cataloging the country's art treasures, establishing a  __[data base](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Database)__    and a  __[network](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entrepreneurial_network)__    of contacts among  __[art dealers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Art_dealer)__   ,  __[auctioneers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Auction)__

   Report: Plane robbed by gunmen in Nigerian airport

 An  __[Air Afrique](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Air_Afrique)__     __[Boeing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeing)__   -727 jet was the third passenger liner looted in the past month by armed robbers while awaiting takeoff at  __[Nigeria's largest international airport](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murtala_Mohammed_International_Airport)__   , the  __[Lagos](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lagos)__     __[Guardian newspaper](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Guardian_(Nigeria))__    reported on Thursday. 

 The thieves broke into the aircraft's luggage compartment and escaped with a large quantity of baggage as the plane was awaiting permission to take off from the Lagos international airport control tower around 9 p.m. on Tuesday night, the Guardian said. It was not clear where the airliner was destined. 

 There was no immediate confirmation of the report. 

 The plane's captain, who noticed the theft, sent a  __[distress call](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distress_signal)__    that went unanswered by airport officials.  __[Security](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airport_security)__    personnel on duty later said said they were unable to capture the culprits because their only security vehicle had been taken away for routine maintenance. 

 In another incident last week involving an unidentified passenger jet, landing gear worth dlrs 1 million was stripped from while the plane was waiting to take off, the newspaper said. In May, a  __[Cameroon Airlines](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cameroon_Airlines)__    plane was robbed of its luggage after armed thieves blocked the plane on the  __[tarmac](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tarmac)__    with a large log.

 First Union, the nation's sixth-largest bank, confirmed the firings Friday, but company spokeswoman Sandy Deem would not release more details. 

 

 The bank "will not tolerate conduct that interferes with another person's work performance or creates an intimidating, offensive or  __[hostile environment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hostile_environment_sexual_harassment)__   ,'' Deem said. 

 

  __[The Charlotte Observer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Charlotte_Observer)__    reported Friday that employees at the University Research Park office circulated e-mail that included videos of people having sex and other material of a sexual nature.

   Businessman killed in Siberian town

 Yuri Zinin, the head of  __[Sibneft](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gazprom_Neft)__    Company was shot in the back as he walked out of his apartment building in the town of Leninsk-Kuzntesky in the  __[Kemerovo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kemerovo)__    region of central  __[Siberia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Siberia)__   , Russian news agencies quoted local police as saying. 

 Zinin's company has the same name as one of  __[Russia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russia)__   's largest oil producers, Sibneft, controlled by controversial business  __[mogul](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Business_magnate)__     __[Boris Berezovsky](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boris_Berezovsky_(businessman))__   .

 Zinin's Sibneft was locally-based and mostly involved in selling  __[oil products](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oil)__    and  __[coal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coal)__   . Kemerovo is one of Russia's main  __[coal-mining](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coal_mining)__    regions. 

 Police launched a search for the killer who fled. Officials wouldn't comment on possible motives for the murder. 

 There are hundreds of  __[contract murder](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contract_killing)__   s in Russia every year as  __[mobsters](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mobsters)__    fight for control of profitable businesses. Only a small number of such killings are ever solved.

 The financial basis for the funding is real estate that belonged to the Jewish communities and fell victim to  __[nationalization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nationalization)__    under the communists. 

 Instead of getting back the actual property _ 152 schools and other buildings _ the assessed value of which is 13,511,000,000  __[forints](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hungarian_forint)__    (dlrs 63 million), the Jewish community collectively is to get a percentage annually, starting with the current year, when 608 million forints (dlrs 2.9 million) will be paid. 

 "The money will be mainly used for education, religious services,  __[social welfare](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Welfare)__   , health service, and charity ends,'' Gusztav Zoltai, executive director of the Federation, said. 

 There are between 80,000 and 100,000 Jews in Hungary. Some 600,000 were killed in  __[the Holocaust](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Holocaust)__   . 

 When the communists assumed full power in 1948, they started a wave of nationalizations that spared no one, including the Jewish community.

   Report:  __[South Africa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Africa)__   n truth panel to condemn ANC

 A panel probing  __[apartheid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apartheid_in_South_Africa)__   -era abuses has accused the  __[African National Congress](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/African_National_Congress)__    of  __[human rights](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_rights)__    violations, including  __[torture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Torture)__    and  __[bomb](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bomb)__    attacks, the state  __[broadcaster](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Broadcasting)__    said Monday. 

 The ANC, which led the struggle against  __[white rule](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dominant_minority)__    and now is in power, previously has acknowledged it was told to expect implication in right violations. 

 The  __[Truth and Reconciliation Commission](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Truth_and_Reconciliation_Commission_(South_Africa))__    will release its final report on 2 1-2 years of investigation on Thursday. The report was expected to place overwhelming blame for the era's abuses on white governments and their brutal security services. 

  __[South African Broadcasting Corp.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_African_Broadcasting_Corporation)__    radio said it had been leaked a "preliminary document'' which condemns the ANC as politically and morally responsible for gross human rights violations during and after the fall of apartheid. 

 An ANC spokesman, Thabo Masebe, said he believed the news report referred to a commission letter sent in advance "informing us of its intention to implicate the ANC in gross human rights violations.'' 

 Commission officials could not immediately be reached for comment. 

 The ANC was nervous enough about the report to request a meeting with  __[commissioners](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commissioner)__    earlier this month. The panel refused, to avoid appearing embarrassed. 

 The party says the accusations against it likely would center on the planting of  __[land mines](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Land_mine)__    on border farms, abuses at its military camps in  __[Angola](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angola)__

   Iranian POW negotiator holds talks with Iraqi ministers

 The head of  __[Iran](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iran)__   's  __[prisoner of war](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prisoner_of_war)__    commission met with two  __[Iraqi Cabinet ministers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cabinet_of_Iraq)__    Saturday in a bid to glean information about thousands of Iranian POWs allegedly in Iraq, the official  __[Iraqi News Agency](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Iraqi_News_Agency)__    reported. 

 Iraqi Foreign Minister  __[Mohammed Saeed al-Sahhaf](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muhammad_Saeed_al-Sahhaf)__    told Abdullah al-Najafi that the two states needed to "speed up the closure of what remains from the POW and  __[Missing-In-Action](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Missing_in_action)__    file,'' INA said. 

 The issue of POWs and missing persons remains a stumbling block to normalizing relations between the two neighbors. 

 Iraq has long maintained that it has released all Iranian prisoners captured in the 1980-88  __[Iran-Iraq War](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iran–Iraq_War)__   . The countries accuse each other of hiding POWs and preventing visits by the  __[International Committee of the Red Cross](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Committee_of_the_Red_Cross)__    to prisoner camps. 

 The ICRC representative in  __[Baghdad](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baghdad)__   , Manuel Bessler, told The  __[Associated Press](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Associated_Press)__

   Austrian president tells Albright of effort to identify  __[stolen art](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Art_theft)__   

  __[Austria](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Austria)__   's president told  __[Secretary of State](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secretary_of_State)__     __[Madeleine Albright](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Madeleine_Albright)__    on Thursday that the government was establishing a commission to identify art which was stolen from  __[Holocaust](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Holocaust)__    victims by the  __[Nazis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nazism)__   . 

 Austrian officials said President  __[Thomas Klestil](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Klestil)__    told Albright, who paid a one-day visit to Vienna after the  __[Moscow](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moscow)__    summit, that the commission would first determine the origin of all art works owned by the Federal Museum here. 

 There was no statement on the art issue by U.S. officials. Albright left for the  __[United States](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States)__    after meetings with Klestil, Chancellor  __[Viktor Klima](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viktor_Klima)__    and Foreign Minister  __[Wolfgang Schuessel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wolfgang_Schüssel)__   . 

 Austria, the United States and 37 other nations have launched a drive to identify billions of dollars worth of art stolen from Holocaust victims throughout Europe. 

 The  __[World Jewish Congress](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Jewish_Congress)__    estimates the current value of stolen art at between dlrs 90 billion and dlrs 140 billion. 

 In June, the  __[Association of Art Museum Directors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_of_Art_Museum_Directors)__    in the United States recommended that American art museums check their own collections to determine if any works were stolen during the war and set up a worldwide database for tracking. 

 Austria was absorbed into  __[Adolf Hitler](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adolf_Hitler)__   's  __[Germany](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germany)__
