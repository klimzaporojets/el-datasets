__[Kurdish](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kurds)__ __[YPG](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/People's_Protection_Units)__, __[Assad](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bashar_al-Assad)__ regime clash in __[Hasakeh](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Al-Hasakah)__
The __[Kurdish](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kurds)__ __[YPG](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/People's_Protection_Units)__ militia has launched a bid to take __[Hasakeh](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Al-Hasakah)__ after calling on pro-government militias to surrender. Fighting over the divided city marks the most violent confrontation between the __[YPG](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/People's_Protection_Units)__ and __Syrian__ regime yet.
__[Kurdish](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kurds)__ militia launched a major assault __Monday__ to capture the entire city of __[Hasakeh](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Al-Hasakah)__ and called on remaining pro-government forces to surrender. The fighting appears to have undone tacit understandings between the __[YPG](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/People's_Protection_Units)__ and the __Syrian__ army that had kept __[Hasakeh](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Al-Hasakah)__ relatively calm during the past five-year conflict. The __Syrian__ air force attacked the armed __[Kurdish](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kurds)__ group for the first time during the war last week, prompting the __[US](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States)__-led military coalition to scramble aircraft to protect __American__ special forces troops deployed alongside the __[YPG](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/People's_Protection_Units)__. __[US Navy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Navy)__ __Captain__ __[Jeff Davis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/None)__ warned __[Damascus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Damascus)__ that the __[US](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States)__-led coalition would do what was needed to protect its forces on the ground. "The __Syrian__ regime would be well advised not to do things that would place them at risk," __[Davis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/None)__ said __Friday__. __Syrian__ state media accuses the __[YPG](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/People's_Protection_Units)__-affiliated security force known as the __[Asayish](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asayish_(NES_regions))__ of violating a ceasefire. That was denied in a leafleting campaign that said the __[YPG](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/People's_Protection_Units)__ intended to take control. "To all the elements of the regime and its militias who are besieged in the city you are targeted by our units," the leaflets read. The loss of __[Hasakeh](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Al-Hasakah)__ would be a strategic blow to __President__ __[Bashar Assad](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bashar_al-Assad)__'s government and would be a setback for __[Russia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russia)__, which has given air support to __[Assad](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bashar_al-Assad)__'s forces to prevent further territorial losses in the country. Thousands of civilians in the city, which is a mix of __[Arabs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arabs)__ and __[Kurds](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kurds)__, including members of the __[Christian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christianity)__ community, have fled to villages in the countryside as the fighting intensified, residents said. Fighting around __[Hasakeh](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Al-Hasakah)__ has killed 43 people including 27 civilians, among them 11 children, since __Wednesday__, according to the __Britain__-based __[Syrian Observatory for Human Rights](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syrian_Observatory_for_Human_Rights)__. Thousands of civilians have now fled __[Hasakeh](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Al-Hasakah)__, where electricity has been cut and bakeries shut. __jar/rc (Reuters, AFP, AP)__
