__[US](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States)__  prepares for fight over __[EU](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Union)__  subsidies to __[Airbus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airbus)__ 
__[EU](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Union)__  subsidies for __[Airbus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airbus)__  have long been a source of tension with the __[United States](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States)__ . Despite __[EU](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Union)__  claims to have ended the financing, a skeptical __[Washington](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington,_D.C.)__  is now preparing for a fight at the __[World Trade Organization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Trade_Organization)__ .
__[United States](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States)__  trade officials said __Friday__ that they were asking the __[World Trade Organization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Trade_Organization)__  to sanction the __[European Union](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Union)__  for alleged subsidies to __aircraft manufacturer__ __[Airbus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airbus)__ . __[Washington](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington,_D.C.)__  said the __[EU](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Union)__  claimed in __December 2011__ to have removed all subsidies to __[Airbus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airbus)__  that broke the __[WTO](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Trade_Organization)__  rules, but that the 27-member bloc never provided evidence. The __[US](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States)__  complained that not only have the subsidies continued, but that new subsidies have been introduced. "We refuse to stand by while __American__ businesses and workers are disadvantaged," __[US](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States)__  __Trade Representative__ __[Ron Kirk](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ron_Kirk)__  said in a statement. "By taking this action today, we are reiterating the __[Obama](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barack_Obama)__  administration's commitment to ensuring that every one of our trading partners plays by the rules, and that __American__ companies can compete on a level playing field," he added. The formal complaint to the __[WTO](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Trade_Organization)__  is to be submitted at a meeting of the __[WTO Dispute Settlement Body](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dispute_Settlement_Body)__  on __April 13__. __[EU](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Union)__  'regrets' action The __[WTO](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Trade_Organization)__  ruled last __June__ that the __[EU](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Union)__  and four member states had provided more than __$18 billion__ (__13.5 billion euros__) in unfair subsidies to __[Airbus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airbus)__  - an amount the __[EU](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Union)__  disputes. The __[US](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States)__  and the __[EU](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Union)__  began talks in __January__ on compliance with the __[WTO](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Trade_Organization)__  order, but both sides held their ground. "We regret that the __[US](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States)__  has chosen to take this step, since the __[EU](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Union)__  notified its compliance with its __[WTO](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Trade_Organization)__  obligations in the package of steps taken at the end of __2011__, and the __[US](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States)__  has yet to do the same in the __[Boeing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeing)__  case," said the __[European Commission](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Commission)__ 's __trade spokesman__ __[John Clancy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/None)__ . The __[WTO](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Trade_Organization)__  has also found that the __[US](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States)__  government paid __$3 billion__ to __$4 billion__ to domestic __aircraft maker__ __[Boeing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeing)__  in the form of research grants and tax breaks. The __[US](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States)__  has argued that the __[EU](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Union)__  had made __[Airbus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airbus)__  dependant on its financing for "every model of large civil aircraft," while no similar conclusion was found in the __[US](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States)__ -__[Boeing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeing)__  relationship. __acb/msh (AFP, Reuters)__

__[Nigeria](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nigeria)__  analyst predicts security revamp after __[Buhari](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muhammadu_Buhari)__  victory
As the vote count progressed in __[Nigeria](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nigeria)__  on __Tuesday__, victory by former __military ruler__ __[Muhammadu Buhari](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muhammadu_Buhari)__  looked increasingly certain. To find out about the implications of this, __[DW](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deutsche_Welle)__  spoke to __analyst__ __[Manji Cheto](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/None)__ .
__[DW](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deutsche_Welle)__ : How do you think __[Nigeria](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nigeria)__  is likely to change under __[Muhammadu Buhari](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muhammadu_Buhari)__ ? __[Manji Cheto](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/None)__ : Nobody has a definitive answer as to what his government could be like but there are clearly important clues that we could take from his previous two and a half year stint as military leader. I think the most symbolic thing about his victory is that he has a reputation as one of the most incorruptible leaders in __[Nigeria](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nigeria)__ . In a country where that reputation is not believed to exist for people occupying a senior position, that is quite significant. Now it is left to be seen whether or not that is going to have a positive impact on his government and the people who take on the positions in his government. Again, if you look at what is happening with __[Nigeria](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nigeria)__ 's key economic indices – __Nigerian__ stock, __Nigerian__ bond yields – a lot of those things have decelerated quite rapidly and I think that is a reflection of waning investor confidence in the country. With __[Nigeria](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nigeria)__  now demonstrating to the world that it is capable of changing a government and [bringing in] a guy who has a positive reputation, that is quite significant. That investor boost could actually see more money being pumped into the __Nigerian__ economy. Do you see any immediate change forthcoming in the way __[Nigeria](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nigeria)__  is handling the __[Boko Haram](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boko_Haram)__  insurgency? I don't think so. I think one of the things we can definitely expect before we talk about a change of strategy is a change in security personnel. __[Buhari](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muhammadu_Buhari)__  having been a military leader, he understands __[Nigeria](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nigeria)__ 's military, its weaknesses and strengths, and he is certainly going to want to have people who he can trust and who he can work with. So I think the most immediate change we are going to see is a change in the security apparatus. __[Buhari](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muhammadu_Buhari)__  is a former military ruler, as you said, but he says he is now a ‘converted democrat.' How much doubt is there in __[Nigeria](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nigeria)__  about his commitment to democratic governance? You're going to get a fifty-fifty doubt. There are people who are going to be incredibly cynical. That is one of the key challenges that he has, reconciling with the people who feel aggrieved by Jonathan's exit from office. So, yes, I think at the moment there is a fair bit of cynicism on that front. __[Nigeria](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nigeria)__  is divided into a mainly __Muslim__ north and a mainly __[Christian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christianity)__  south. As a __Muslim__ from the north, will __[Buhari](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muhammadu_Buhari)__  be able to unite the country behind him? The __Muslim__ north and __[Christian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christianity)__  south dichotomy is far more complex than that. If you look at the south, particularly the southwest, there is a considerable number of __Muslims__ there. And __[Buhari](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muhammadu_Buhari)__  has allied himself with the southwest where people are __Muslims__ who identify with the __[Islamic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islam)__  faith, but they don't actively practice Islam. So I think it is far more complex and I think a lot of __Nigerians__ will start to look beyond that to see if he can demonstrate himself to be a true __Nigerian__ president, as opposed to a northern president. I think the fact that he is aligned with the southwest is a key positive development in that respect. What about __[Nigeria](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nigeria)__ 's relations with its neighbors? Do you see this changing under a __President__ __[Buhari](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muhammadu_Buhari)__ ? I don't think that is going to be a priority for the new government. I think the priority will certainly be dealing with the internal challenges and some of the military weaknesses. Once that is addressed I think the relationship with neighbors, which has been a bit tense in recent times over security, will start to improve. The elections are not over. There are gubernatorial and state assembly polls on __April 11__. How do you see them playing out in the wake of __[Buhari](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muhammadu_Buhari)__ 's victory? The presidential election has been tightly contested so I expect the same to happen. There are obviously going to be a number of key flashpoints. Key battlegrounds will include places like the economically powerful __[Lagos](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lagos_State)__  and __[Rivers State](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rivers_State)__  which is the largest oil producing state. The outcome of those elections is quite significant for whether we can look at the broader electoral process and judge it to be free and fair and quite credible. __[Manji Cheto](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/None)__  is the vice president of __[Teneo Intelligence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teneo)__ , a risk analysis organization in __[London](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London)__  __Interview: Asumpta Lattus__

The state's tax coffers were empty, which made it time to turn to a mighty neighbor to save the country from bankruptcy: That was the state of affairs in __[Ukraine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ukraine)__  a year ago, in mid-__December 2013__, when then-__President__ __[Viktor Yanukovych](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viktor_Yanukovych)__  traveled to __[Moscow](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moscow)__ . __Russian__ __President__ __[Vladimir Putin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vladimir_Putin)__  promised __[Ukraine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ukraine)__  __$15 billion__ (__12 billion euros__) in loans. A year later, __[Ukraine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ukraine)__  again seeks help abroad - but this time in __[Europe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Union)__ . Additional funds are bound to be at the top of the agenda when __Prime Minister__ __[Arseniy Yatsenyuk](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arseniy_Yatsenyuk)__  heads to __[Brussels](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brussels)__  on __Monday__ (__15.12.__) for the first meeting of the __[EU](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Union)__ -__[Ukraine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ukraine)__  __[Association Council](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/None)__ , a body created to help implement the __[Association Agreement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ukraine–European_Union_Association_Agreement)__  signed in __June__ between the __[EU](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Union)__  and __[Ukraine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ukraine)__ . The main thrust of the accord - freeing up trade between __[Ukraine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ukraine)__  and the 28-member bloc - has, however, been shelved until the end of __2015__ due to massive __Russian__ criticism. Sympathy, disappointment in __[Brussels](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brussels)__  Hard-hit by the war against the pro-__Russian__ separatists, __[Ukraine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ukraine)__ 's financial needs have almost doubled. Next year, __[Ukraine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ukraine)__  will need an extra __$15 billion__ in addition to the loan granted by the __[International Monetary Fund](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Monetary_Fund)__  (__[IMF](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Monetary_Fund)__ ), __[Yatsenyuk](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arseniy_Yatsenyuk)__  told parliament on __Thursday__, quoting an estimate by the "__[Financial Times](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Financial_Times)__ ." The __[IMF](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Monetary_Fund)__  has earmarked a total of __$16.7 billion__, a quarter of which has already been transferred. __[Ukraine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ukraine)__  is in no position to prevent national insolvency on its own, __[Yatsenyuk](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arseniy_Yatsenyuk)__  warned, adding, "It's practically impossible without the help of our international partners." The __[Kyiv](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kiev)__  government hopes to collect the missing amount at an international donors' conference. No firm date has yet been set, and observers suspect the __[West](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_world)__  wanted to wait for early elections and the formation of a government - a process concluded earlier this month. Officials in __[Brussels](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brussels)__  have said they understand the difficult situation in __[Ukraine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ukraine)__ , __[Daniel Gros](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daniel_Gros)__  told __[DW](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deutsche_Welle)__ . "__[Kyiv](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kiev)__  has the huge problem that it can't simultaneously build up a big army, reform the economy and keep the population happy," the director of the __[Center for European Policy Studies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centre_for_European_Policy_Studies)__  (__[CEPS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centre_for_European_Policy_Studies)__ ) said. All the same, he added, __[Brussels](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brussels)__  is disappointed. "No one has really seen reforms being implemented," __[Gros](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daniel_Gros)__  said. "That's true for the economy, the police and the judicial system." The __[EU](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Union)__ , the expert added, expects to see "radical reforms in those sectors." Reform package in hand __[Ukraine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ukraine)__ 's prime minister appears to be aware of the __[EU](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Union)__ 's wary stance, so he isn't going to __[Brussels](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brussels)__  with nothing but an outstretched hand. He'll also be bringing a list of reform plans: drastic state spending and subsidy cuts; tariffs for power, water, gas and heating for private households doubled or even tripled; the retirement age could rise from 60 to 63; and there are plans to replace free medical care with an insurance system. Subsidies for small wage earners will be reduced or even completely cut. In __March__, the __[EU](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Union)__  promised __[Ukraine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ukraine)__  an aid package of about __11 billion euros__. Only a small percentage has been disbursed - the rest depends on the reforms. The lion's share of the foreign aid for __[Ukraine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ukraine)__  is bound to go right back abroad. This year alone, __[Ukraine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ukraine)__  repaid "debts and loans worth __$14 billion__," __[Yatsenyuk](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arseniy_Yatsenyuk)__  told parliament. That was a mistake, according to __[Gros](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daniel_Gros)__ . __[Ukraine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ukraine)__ , he said, should instead negotiate a deferral of debt payments. About 1 percent of the __10 billion euros__ from __[EU](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Union)__  coffers is earmarked for humanitarian aid and economic restructuring, according to an analysis by __[Gros](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daniel_Gros)__  and his __colleague__ __[Steven Blockmans](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/None)__ . In the face of rampant corruption, they said, such aid programs are but a "drop in a bucket." The expert suggested the __[EU](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Union)__  should take unusual measures in __[Ukraine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ukraine)__ . Instead of transferring money to __[Kyiv](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kiev)__  as usual, the __[EU](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Union)__  should open a host of small offices across the country and hand out cash directly to the needy, he said.

New floating objects spotted as stormy weather grounds aircraft searching for __[MH370](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malaysia_Airlines_Flight_370)__ 
__[Thailand](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thailand)__  has said its satellite images showed 300 floating objects near the search zone in the southern __[Indian Ocean](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_Ocean)__ . Meanwhile, thunderstorms and strong winds have forced search teams to temporarily suspend operations.
__[Thailand](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thailand)__  said on __Thursday__ it could have a lead on possible wreckage from missing __[Malaysian Airlines](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malaysia_Airlines)__  __flight__ __[MH370](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malaysia_Airlines_Flight_370)__ , according to media reports.

__German__ Seniors Say No to Nursing Homes
Members of __[Germany](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germany)__  older generation are looking at new models of living for their retirement years. They want security, comfort and social contacts; they don’t want a nursing home. Senior flat shares fit that bill.
On the eighth floor of a __[Dresden](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dresden)__  high-rise, 72-year-old __[Karl-Heinz Röttjer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/None)__  can look out from his small, one-bedroom apartment and see a good portion of the city and the hills that spill over into the __[Czech Republic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Czech_Republic)__ . To him, the wide-open vista represents freedom, and the new lease on life he has gotten since moving in with five retired women to share his sunset years. "Here I feel much better, I can spend my time how I want," he said. "I feel free, and it's like I have a family around me." He cherishes that freedom since it was taken away from him for a while. He was put in a nursing home after an illness made him unable to live alone anymore several years ago. His wife had died and his children had moved away. But for this spry, independent septuagenarian, it was like being put in prison. "In a nursing home, you're not your own master," he said. "There are rules to follow and you've subject to strict schedules. Everything's planned out and you feel almost trapped." So he escaped, not by climbing out an open window, but by answering an ad for a living arrangement that experts say could become a common alternative for older people in the future: a senior flat share. Not long after, he moved into the specially modified suite of apartments and hasn't looked back. Communal living but privacy, too The senior flat share, however, is generally not like the basic college-age roommate situation. __[Röttjer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/None)__  has his own apartment with a kitchen and bathroom, as does each of his five flatmates. They provide privacy and independence which are important to older people. But there is also a common room with comfortable furniture, a dining table and a TV, plus a communal kitchen and dining table where people can prepare and eat shared meals if they want. The __[Dresden](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dresden)__  suite also has a large bathroom that has been outfitted with special aid devices for when age makes getting around, or in and out of the bathtub, more difficult. There are at least 200 similar experiments in senior living across __[Germany](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germany)__  as the older generation rethinks how they want to live out their sunset years and more are popping up all the time. The senior living arrangement was even the topic of a reality TV show on the __German__-__French__ __channel__ __[arte](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arte)__ , which brought five women between 60 and 70 together in a __[Berlin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berlin)__  apartment and followed the ups and downs of their new lives there. Surveys have found that more than two-thirds of people now over the age of 40 have no interest in going into an old age home in the future. "My generation does not want to go into these so-called social institutions for old, helpless people," said __[Heike Grünewald](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/None)__ , who heads __[Projekt 50 Plus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/wikidata:Q1669662)__ , a __[Berlin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berlin)__ -based group which tries to match up seniors and communal living arrangements. "We do not want the state looking after us. Besides, the state will not have any money to do it, so we have to look after ourselves." Greying society __[Germany](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germany)__ 's older population is set to skyrocket over the next decades. Demographers forecast that by __2050__, more than one in three __Germans__ will be over 60. While most __European__ societies are getting older, in 30 years, due to low birth rates and longer life spans, it is predicted that __[Germany](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germany)__  will have the oldest population in the world. "That means we have to look at and encourage these different models of senior living," said __[Irmingard Schewe-Gerigk](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/wikidata:Q1313840)__ , a parliamentarian for the __[Green](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alliance_90/The_Greens)__  party who looks at aging issues. __[Germany](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germany)__ 's system for financing care for older people is fast running short of cash. The government pays for part or all of nursing home care, which is expensive, so it's beginning to show interest in the alternatives. One study has shown that having a senior in an apartment share can save the government more than __51,000 euros__ (__$66,000__) a year. In the __[Dresden](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dresden)__  flat share, each resident pays between __270__ to __390 euros__ rent to a real estate developer who renovated the apartment. "In a flat share, people do just fine with their own money, they're able to manage," said __[Sieglinde Wartenberg](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/None)__ , who arranges senior apartment shares in __[Dresden](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dresden)__ . "They can get by on just a little money, and age with dignity." Social connection Besides the financial aspect, there's a social element of living with others that is just as, if not more, important for older people. One of the greatest fears of the elderly is social isolation. "At some point, you feel that you just aren't needed," said __[Irene Rostalskie](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/None)__ , 72. "Hardly anyone has time for you anymore." She raised six children, but one by one they moved away until she was alone in her ground-floor apartment. One day someone broke her window and she felt not only alone, but insecure. The flat share solves both of those problems. "It's one of the main advantages to this living arrangement, there's always someone there who I can ring up or go see," said __[Richard Palm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/None)__ , head of the __[Forum for Communal Living](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/None)__ . "If I'm feeling sick, there will be someone coming and saying, should I get you a newspaper or call a doctor." Around the common table in the suite, the flatmates joke and laugh like teenagers while they offer visitors coffee and cake. They make sure all guests write their names in a black notebook they keep; last year, there were 47 entries. The flatmates often take group day trips around the regions, visiting neighboring towns or going to the theater. "In a nursing home, you get old very quickly," said __[Sylvia Behrens](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/None)__ , who at 57 is the youngest of the group, but who suffers from __[Parkinson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parkinson's_disease)__

'Land is becoming a scarce commodity'
The __[UN](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations)__  __[Committee on World Food Security](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Committee_on_World_Food_Security)__  on __Friday__ adopted draft guidelines against land grabbing to better protect rural communities. __[DW](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deutsche_Welle)__  spoke to the __[UN](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations)__ 's __Special Rapporteur on the Right to Food__, __[Olivier De Schutter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olivier_De_Schutter)__ .
The __[UN](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations)__ 's new guidelines against land grabbing came after an outcry by developing countries over the large farmland that is being bought by rich nations. __[DW](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deutsche_Welle)__ : __Mr__ __[de Shutter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olivier_De_Schutter)__ , in summary, what does the draft against land grabbing state? __[Olivier De Schutter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olivier_De_Schutter)__ : The draft guidelines on the responsible governance of tenures of land, fisheries and forests are guidelines that seek to clarify what states should do in order to protect land users. Essentially, in many countries land users are not legally recognized as the owners of the land. This is particularly the case in __[Africa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Africa)__  - in rural parts of __[Africa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Africa)__  - where land is considered to be owned by the state. And the state very often gives away this land to investors who offer to develop this land, and land users who depend on this land for their livelihoods are evicted without having access to legal remedies and without being protected from the loss of their livelihoods. And so these guidelines seek to clarify what states should do, how they should consult, which compensation they should provide in order to reduce the impacts of land grabbing on these rural communities in __[Africa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Africa)__ . How has the land grabbing of large farmland in developing countries, especially __African__ countries, violated human rights? These are very poor populations which are not very influential politically. And they have been unable as yet to mobilize and to effectively challenge this phenomenon that is called land grabbing and that is essentially the result of the growing worldwide demand for natural resources. Since __2008__, and __2009__ in particular, both the private sector - private companies - and governments are interested in buying and leasing large areas of land and having access to water underneath the land, because land is becoming a scarce commodity. And we are entering into a phase of repeated crisis where prices of food commodities in particular will be more and more volatile. These actors seek to protect their access to national resources by buying land which in many cases rural communities depend on. And human rights such as the right to food, right to housing, even the right to life sometimes are threatened by this phenomenon. Which __African__ countries are most affected by land grabbing? Two thirds of land grabbing is taking place in __[sub-Saharan Africa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sub-Saharan_Africa)__ . In weakly governed zones where governments are not effectively protecting the populations and where courts are not able to protect communities who depend on access to natural resources. Many of these lands are given away by governments, often unfortunately as a result of corruption and because the local elites benefit from these transactions but not the rural communities who remain underprotected. To what extent does land grabbing contribute to food security or insecurity? The land grabbing results in large-scale plantations being developed that are highly mechanized and that are relatively less-labor-intensive than the small-scale family farming that's usually practiced by rural communities in developing countries. The result of this is that, in general, less employment will be created. A large number of people may lose their livelihoods and their access to the land on which they depend for their food. And for those who do not find employment on these large-scale plantations, it will mean that they will be without revenues and without adequate livelihoods. The result is that these people will migrate to the cities in the hope of finding employment in the industry and service sectors, but in many cases, those jobs are not be easy to find. And so the result is social disruption, more poverty and inequality in the rural areas and that is what we want to avoid. How does the __[UN](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations)__  plan to ensure that human rights standards are maintained where huge lands are bought by foreigners? The work of the __[Committee on World Food Security](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Committee_on_World_Food_Security)__  today is meant to designate a set of principles that states should respect in order to better protect the land users. These principles should be implemented in domestic legislation. They should be a source of reference for courts and national human rights institutions, and states should be gradually led to report back on how they implement these guidelines. This will be supervised at international level by the __[Committee on World Food Security](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Committee_on_World_Food_Security)__  that will regularly collect information as to how these guidelines are being complied with at a domestic level. It is not enough. It is something however - it is a departure point and it is certainly important in this current context to provide some international framework to define what states are expected to do. __Interview: Chrispin Mwakideu /sst Editor: Susan Houlton__

__[Ukraine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ukraine)__ , financial crisis overshadows __[EPP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_People's_Party)__  convention
__[Vitaly Klitschko](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vitali_Klitschko)__  and __[Yulia Tymoshenko](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yulia_Tymoshenko)__  have addressed delegates at the __[European People's Party](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_People's_Party)__  (__[EPP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_People's_Party)__ ) convention in __[Dublin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dublin)__  - but it appears they both expect too much from the __[EU](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Union)__ .
Delegates of the conservative __[European People's Party](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_People's_Party)__  (__[EPP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_People's_Party)__ ), a grouping of center-right parties in the __[European Parliament](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Parliament)__ , have met for a two-day congress in __[Dublin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dublin)__  on __Thursday__ (__06.03.2014__) to nominate a front-runner ahead of elections in __May__. The winner could well become the next president of the __[European Commission](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Commission)__  - that is if the __[EPP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_People's_Party)__ , now the largest political grouping in parliament, manages to secure most of people's votes again. However, delegates are talking about little else but __[Ukraine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ukraine)__ . Before the debate kicked off, __[EPP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_People's_Party)__ 's chairman __[Joseph Daul](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_Daul)__  had asked for a minute of silence "in remembrance of the __Ukrainian__ victims who have died for their flag and also for the __European__ flag, which symbolizes our set of values," he said. "We will never accept aggression against a sovereign state." However, what was meant as strong support for __Ukrainians__ may ring hollow to many. After all, what can the __[EU](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Union)__ , let alone a __European__ party, really do against the de-facto __Russian__ occupation of the __[Crimean Peninsula](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crimea)__ ? Expectations are too high __Ukrainian__ __politicians__ __[Yulia Tymoshenko](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yulia_Tymoshenko)__  and __[Vitaly Klitschko](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vitali_Klitschko)__  had both been invited to speak to the delegates. Former heavy-weight boxer __[Klitschko](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vitali_Klitschko)__  had led demonstrations against President __[Victor Yanukovych](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viktor_Yanukovych)__  in __[Kyiv](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kiev)__  for weeks, while __[Tymoshenko](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yulia_Tymoshenko)__  was freed from prison as soon as __[Yanukovych](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viktor_Yanukovych)__  was ousted. However, their expectations on what the __[EU](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Union)__  could do were far from being realistic. Both politicians offered no clear answer to the question what the __[EU](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Union)__  could do about the __Crimean__ issue. However, __[Klitschko](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vitali_Klitschko)__  said his first goal was "__[Ukraine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ukraine)__ 's accession to the __[EU](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Union)__ ", secondly, "immediate talks with __[NATO](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NATO)__ ." But both his demands are out of reach. The __[EU](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Union)__  has practically given up on __[Ukraine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ukraine)__  becoming a member of the bloc - even under a pro-__European__ government - while __[NATO](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NATO)__  is relieved it is not obliged to defend non-member state __[Ukraine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ukraine)__  against __[Russia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russia)__ . Financial crisis lingers on Apart from __[Ukraine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ukraine)__ , there is a second crisis at hand - the bloc's financial crisis. Consequences are still being felt in many countries, particularly in Ireland. Despite the country's success at leaving __[Europe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Union)__ 's bailout program, __[Ireland](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ireland)__  has been paying a heavy price in terms of high unemployment and poverty. Demonstrators put up a banner in front of __[Dublin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dublin)__ 's __[Convention Center](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convention_Centre_Dublin)__  where the __[EPP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_People's_Party)__  delegates have gathered that reads: "__[Merkel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angela_Merkel)__  and __[EPP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_People's_Party)__ , austerity kills us." For some of __[Ireland](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ireland)__ 's citizens it seems to be __German__ __Chancellor__ __[Angela Merkel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angela_Merkel)__
