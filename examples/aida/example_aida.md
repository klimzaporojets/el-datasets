Leftist __[Mexican](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mexico)__  armed group says troops in capital.

__[MEXICO CITY](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mexico_City)__  1996-08-25

The leftist __[Popular Revolutionary Army](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Popular_Revolutionary_Army)__  (__[EPR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/None)__ ) in a published report on Sunday said it operated throughout __[Mexico](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mexico)__ , including the capital, and denied government assertions it was isolated to one state.

Commanders "__[Vicente](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/None)__ " and "__[Oscar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/None)__ ", guarded by a dozen __[EPR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/None)__  gunmen, said in an interview with __[La Jornada](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/La_Jornada)__  outside __[Mexico City](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mexico_City)__  that the armed group was committed to overthrowing the government.

"They (government officials) want to present us before public opinion as a local problem, as just being from __[Guerrero](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guerrero)__  and as irrational radicals," Commander __[Oscar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/None)__  told __[La Jornada](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/La_Jornada)__ .

They said the __[ERP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/None)__ , whose fighters first appeared wearing military fatigues and brandishing assault rifles in the southwestern state of __[Guerrero](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guerrero)__  on June 28, had a 23,000-strong membership, but this could not be confirmed independently.

__[La Jornada](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/La_Jornada)__  also reported on Sunday that the __[Mexican Army](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mexican_Army)__  has discovered a 37-page, __[EPR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/None)__  manual detailing guerrilla tactics and strategies.

It quoted the manual as saying: "The objective of the Basic Course on War is to provide for combatants of the __[EPR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/None)__  basic military knowledge for the armed conflict against the police and military apparatus of the bourgeoisie."

It was the second time armed "commanders" of the __[EPR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/None)__  have granted interviews outside __[Guerrero](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guerrero)__  state, an extremely poor and volatile region where leftist protesters often have clashed violently with authorities.

Unlike the better known and unrelated __[Zapatista](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zapatista_Army_of_National_Liberation)__  rebels in southeastern __[Chiapas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chiapas)__  state, the __[EPR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/None)__  has never taken on the army in direct combat, according to official reports. There have only been a few skirmishes in __[Guerrero](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guerrero)__

SOCCER-CHAMPIONS __[PORTO](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/F\u002eC\u002e_Porto)__  KICK OFF SEASON WITH A DRAW.

__[LISBON](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lisbon)__  1996-08-25

__[Portuguese](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portugal)__  champions __[Porto](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/F\u002eC\u002e_Porto)__  kicked off the season with a disappointing 2-2 home draw against __[Setubal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/None)__  and were lucky to squeeze in an equaliser in extra time.

__[Porto](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/F\u002eC\u002e_Porto)__ , who are fighting to take their third consecutive title this season, were 2-0 down until the 86th minute when a header by __[Mario Jardel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M\u00e1rio_Jardel)__  found the net after a string of missed opportunities, including a penalty taken by top league scorer __[Domingos Oliveira](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/None)__  in the 60th minute.

__[Domingos](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/None)__  redeemed himself by netting the equaliser just into extra time.

__[Setubal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/None)__ , who put on a skilful counter-attack throughout the game, opened the scoring 16 minutes into the match when an unmarked __[Chiquinho Conde](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chiquinho_Conde)__  shot around __[Porto](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/F\u002eC\u002e_Porto)__ 's new __[Polish](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poland)__  keeper __[Andrejez Wozniak](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/None)__ . __[Conde](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chiquinho_Conde)__  scored his second in the 70th minute.

__[Benfica](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S\u002eL\u002e_Benfica)__ , also playing their first game of the season at home, were held to a 1-1 draw by northern side __[Braga](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S\u002eC\u002e_Braga)__  despite the fact that the visitors were reduced to 10 men in the 54th minute after __[Rodrigo Carneiro](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/None)__  was sent off for a second bookable offence.

__[Benfica](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S\u002eL\u002e_Benfica)__  dominated the game but their lack of a first-class striker was apparent throughout and in the 30th minute they lost key __[Brazilian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brazil)__  midfielder __[Valdo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Valdo_Filho)__  who suffered a light knee injury. He was substituted by __[Paulao](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paulo_Roberto_do_Carmo)__ .

__[Benfica](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S\u002eL\u002e_Benfica)__  finally opened the scoring in the 81st minute with a penalty taken by __[Helder](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/None)__  after __[Luis Baltasar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/None)__  tripped up captain __[Joao Pinto](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jo\u00e3o_Domingos_Pinto)__  under the referee's nose.

__[Argentine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argentina)__  striker __[Gabriel Batistuta](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gabriel_Batistuta)__  gave __[Fiorentina](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ACF_Fiorentina)__  the perfect 70th birthday present on Sunday with two goals that gave the __[Italian Cup](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coppa_Italia)__  winners a 2-1 __[Supercup](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/None)__  victory over __[serie A](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serie_A)__  champions __[Milan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A\u002eC\u002e_Milan)__ .

The victory, coming on the eve of the founding of the __[Florence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florence)__  club in 1926, also marked the first time since the pre-season trophy between the __[Cup](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coppa_Italia)__  winners and league champions was started in 1988 that the __[Cup](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coppa_Italia)__  winners had won.

__[Batistuta](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gabriel_Batistuta)__  gave __[Fiorentina](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ACF_Fiorentina)__  the lead in the 11th minute. __[Sweden](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sweden)__ 's __[Stefan Schwarz](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stefan_Schwarz)__  picked him out with a lob to the edge of the box and __[Batistuta](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gabriel_Batistuta)__  did the rest, chipping veteran defender __[Franco Baresi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Franco_Baresi)__  and scoring at the near post.

__[Montenegrin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Montenegrins)__  midfielder __[Dejan Savicevic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dejan_Savi\u0107evi\u0107)__  equalised for the home team, weaving past a defender, checking and firing in a left-footed shot in the 21st minute that gave young __[Fiorentina](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ACF_Fiorentina)__  goalkeeper __[Francesco Toldo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Francesco_Toldo)__  little chance.

__[French](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/France)__  international midfielder __[Marcel Desailly](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marcel_Desailly)__  fouled the __[Argentine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argentina)__ , whose coach at __[Boca Juniors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boca_Juniors)__  before he joined __[Fiorentina](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ACF_Fiorentina)__  in 1991 was new __[Milan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A\u002eC\u002e_Milan)__  coach __[Oscar Tabarez](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/\u00d3scar_Tab\u00e1rez)__ , and __[Batistuta](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gabriel_Batistuta)__  rammed home the free kick from 30 metres out.

__[Coetzer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amanda_Coetzer)__ , ranked 17th, avenged her defeat to __[Huber](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anke_Huber)__  in the __[Australian Open](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Open)__  semifinals by winning 6-1 2-6 6-2.

"I looked at it as not a first round match, just a great challenge for me," said __[Coetzer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amanda_Coetzer)__ , 24. "I was really concentrating on keeping my own momentum and my own rhythm.

"She is tough to play in that way because she plays very up and down. She played one great game and than a few errors. The challenge was just for me to keep playing my own game."

__[Huber](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anke_Huber)__ , who reached the final a week ago at __[Manhattan Beach](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manhattan_Beach\u002c_California)__ , could only mourn her luck of the draw.

"I wasn't happy when I saw the draw. She was the first non- seeded player," said the 21-year-old __[German](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germans)__ . "It's always tough to play somebody like that in the first round in a __[Grand Slam](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grand_Slam_\u0028tennis\u0029)__ .

"I think I didn't play that bad today. It was maybe my best first round match in a __[Grand Slam](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grand_Slam_\u0028tennis\u0029)__  I ever played."

Monday brought the best out in __[U.S. Open](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/US_Open_\u0028tennis\u0029)__  rookie __[Aleksandra Olsza](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aleksandra_Olsza)__  of __[Poland](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poland)__ , ranked 110th.

The 18-year-old __[Olsza](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aleksandra_Olsza)__ , last year's __[Wimbledon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wimbledon_Championships)__  junior champion, celebrated her debut in the main draw of the __[Open](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/None)__  by removing __[Maleeva](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magdalena_Maleeva)__  6-4 6-2.

The curtain-raising victories by __[Hingis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martina_Hingis)__  and __[Olsza](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aleksandra_Olsza)__  provided a ringing endorsement for the newest wave of women's players coming up from the junior ranks.

The __[Swiss](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Switzerland)__  teenager, a twice __[French Open](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_Open)__  junior champion and a __[Wimbledon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wimbledon_Championships)__  juniors winner, had already proven her main stage mettle by reaching the quarters at this year's __[Australian Open](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Open)__ .

"I hope I can get into the last 16," said __[Hingis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martina_Hingis)__ , seeded to face third seed __[Arantxa Sanchez Vicario](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arantxa_S\u00e1nchez_Vicario)__  in the fourth round.

__[Hingis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martina_Hingis)__  has been working hard on conditioning and has lost eight pounds (3.5 kilos) in advance of the championships.

"There will be tough matches but I hope I can get there," she said. "Then we'll see if __[Arantxa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arantxa_Parra_Santonja)__  will be there, too."

The fast-moving __[Olsza](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aleksandra_Olsza)__ , 18, was cool in her opening match.

"I wasn't scared when I heard that I was playing __[Maleeva](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magdalena_Maleeva)__ ," said __[Olsza](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aleksandra_Olsza)__ . "I know that if I want to play professional tennis I have to do my best to try to beat her and I can't be scared."

__[Olsza](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aleksandra_Olsza)__  is undaunted by the level of competition in the pros.

A large group of __[Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liberation_Tigers_of_Tamil_Eelam)__  (__[LTTE](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liberation_Tigers_of_Tamil_Eelam)__ ) rebels stormed the __[Kudapokuna](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/None)__  police post, just north of __[Welikanda](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/None)__ , 200 km (125 miles) from __[Colombo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colombo)__ , before dawn, they said.

"The entire post was overrun," said a defence official.

It was not immediately clear if there were any casualties among the rebels, who are fighting for independence for minority __[Tamils](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tamil_people)__  in the __[Indian Ocean](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/None)__  island's north and east.  

It is the second time in three days that the rebels attacked police.

__[Saskatchewan Wheat Pool](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saskatchewan_Wheat_Pool)__  eyes hog market.

__[WINNIPEG](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Winnipeg)__  1996-08-28

__[Canada](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canada)__ 's largest grain handling firm said Wednesday it expects to forge a partnership with hog farmers by 1997 with a view to expanding the company's scope into pork production.

"__[Saskatchewan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saskatchewan)__  is well positioned to take advantage of growing world markets for pork," __[Saskatchewan Wheat Pool](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saskatchewan_Wheat_Pool)__  chief executive __[Don Loewen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/None)__  said in a company statement.

__[SWP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/None)__  said it was analyzing potential partnerships with hog farmers and expected the first deal to be in place in 1997.

The end of __[Canada](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canada)__ 's rail freight subsidy last year caused a shift in feed grain production to the eastern Prairie.

Analysts said livestock production would likely shift to the eastern Prairie rather than feed grains being shipped to the western Prairie.

__[SWP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/None)__  said it may develop pork production systems that provide farmers with large integrated units, and it may consider contracting programs between producers and packers which would operate within the existing hog market framework.

__[Saskatchewan Pork International Marketing Group](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/None)__  has an export monopoly but some __[Saskatchewan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saskatchewan)__  farmers earlier this month called for an open market in hogs.

__[Ischinger](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wolfgang_Ischinger)__  is the political director of __[Bonn](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bonn)__ 's foreign ministry.

__[Ischinger](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wolfgang_Ischinger)__  said he met three __[Russian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russia)__  deputy foreign ministers and a vice defence minister, who confirmed __[Russian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russia)__  Foreign Minister __[Yevgeny Primakov](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yevgeny_Primakov)__ 's pledge that __[Moscow](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russia)__  would seek a political solution under the aegis of the __[Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/None)__  (__[OSCE](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/None)__ ).

"The ultimatum (to storm __[Grozny](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grozny)__ ) is no longer an issue," he said quoting __[Ischinger](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wolfgang_Ischinger)__ , who had been sent to __[Moscow](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moscow)__  by __[German](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germany)__  Foreign Minister __[Klaus Kinkel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Klaus_Kinkel)__  as his personal envoy to urge an end to __[Moscow](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russia)__ 's military campaign in the breakaway region.

Galeforce winds and heavy rains batter __[Belgium](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Belgium)__ .

__[BRUSSELS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brussels)__  1996-08-29

Torrential rains and galeforce winds battered __[Belgium](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Belgium)__  on Thursday causing widespread damage as some areas had more rainfall in 24 hours than they normally get in a month, the meteorological office said.

Cellars were flooded, trees uprooted and roofs damaged, but there were no reports of any injuries, an interior affairs ministry spokesman said.

Some trains were delayed as fallen trees blocked lines.

__[Brussels](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brussels)__  received 5.6 cm (2.24 inches) of water in the past 24 hours -- compared to an average 7.4 cm (2.96 inches) per month -- but in several communes in the south of the country up to 8 cm (3.2 inches) fell, the __[Royal Meteorological Institute](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Meteorological_Institute)__  (__[RMT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/None)__ ) said.

__[NEW DELHI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Delhi)__  1996-08-22

__[India](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India)__  said on Thursday that its opposition to a global nuclear test ban treaty did not mean __[New Delhi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Delhi)__  intended to enter into an arms race with neighbouring __[Pakistan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pakistan)__  and __[China](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/People\u0027s_Republic_of_China)__ .

Foreign Minister __[I.K.

"I don't see that possibility because __[India](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India)__  is not entering into any arms race," he said. "Our not signing a new treaty does not mean we are going in for any new kind of weapons, particularly nuclear."

__[China](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/People\u0027s_Republic_of_China)__ , along with __[Britain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom)__ , __[France](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/France)__ , __[Russia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russia)__  and the __[United States](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States)__ , is a declared nuclear power. __[India](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India)__  carried out a nuclear test in 1974 but says it has not built the bomb.

Experts believe both __[India](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India)__  and __[Pakistan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pakistan)__  could quickly assemble nuclear weapons.

__[Gujral](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inder_Kumar_Gujral)__  said he did not expect __[India](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India)__ 's veto of the __[Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comprehensive_Nuclear\u002dTest\u002dBan_Treaty)__  (__[CTBT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comprehensive_Nuclear\u002dTest\u002dBan_Treaty)__ ) to damage bilateral ties with other nations.

"I do not visualise its straining our bilateral relations with any country. The text has already been blocked," he said.

__[Gujral](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inder_Kumar_Gujral)__  said __[India](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India)__  would re-examine its position if the treaty, particularly a clause providing for its entry into force, was modified.

Asked what __[India](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India)__  would do if the pact were forwarded to the __[United Nations General Assembly](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/None)__ , __[Gujral](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inder_Kumar_Gujral)__  said: "That bridge I will cross when I come to it."

In a written statement released at the news conference, __[Gujral](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inder_Kumar_Gujral)__  reiterated __[India](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India)__ 's objections to the treaty, under negotiation at the __[Conference on Disarmament](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/None)__  in __[Geneva](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geneva)__ .

"It is a sad fact that the nuclear weapon states show no interest in giving up their nuclear hegemony," the statement said.

__[Gujral](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inder_Kumar_Gujral)__  said __[India](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India)__  had national security concerns that made it impossible for __[New Delhi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Delhi)__  to sign the __[CTBT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comprehensive_Nuclear\u002dTest\u002dBan_Treaty)__ .

__[SVCD Bulgaria](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/None)__  air traffic controllers to strike September 3.

__[SOFIA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sofia)__  1996-08-26

__[Bulgarian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bulgaria)__  air traffic controllers will go on strike on September 3 demanding higher pay, the chief of the __[Bulgarian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bulgaria)__  association of air traffic controllers (__[Bulatka](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/None)__ ) said on Monday.

__[Stefan Raichev](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/None)__  told a news conference the strike by more than half of the 1,380 traffic controllers and technicians would paralyse traffic which has increased by 10 percent since last year.

More than 1,500 planes per day fly over __[Bulgaria](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bulgaria)__ , in a strategic location between __[Europe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Europe)__  and the __[Middle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middle_East)__  and the __[Far East](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/None)__ , __[Raichev](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/None)__  said.

The director general of the air traffic service __[Valentin Valkov](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/None)__  said last Friday that a controllers' strike would be illegal.

__[Valkov](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/None)__  said he could not curb the summer charter flights of national carrier __[Balkan Airlines](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Balkan_Bulgarian_Airlines)__ , which carries thousands of foreign tourists to the __[Bulgarian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bulgaria)__  __[Black Sea](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_Sea)__  resorts.

But __[Raichev](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/None)__  said it would be "discrimination" against the other airlines if only __[Balkan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/None)__  planes were guided in.

"Under the law before launching the strike we have to sign an agreement with our employer for a minimal transport servicing of emergency flights," __[Raichev](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/None)__  said.

__[Raichev](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/None)__  said a lock-out with military air controllers was impossible as they did not speak __[English](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/English_language)__ .

The controllers are demanding the monthly wage be increased to $1,000 per month from the current $230, as well as the resignation of the air traffic service's management.

They also demand the financial separation of the 350 air controllers from the technical staff.

__[Iran](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iran)__  asks __[Bonn](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bonn)__  to extradite ex-president __[Banisadr](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abulhassan_Banisadr)__ .

__[BONN](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bonn)__  1996-08-28

__[Iran](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iran)__  has asked __[Germany](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germany)__  to extradite its former president __[Abolhassan Banisadr](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abulhassan_Banisadr)__  for alleged hijacking, an __[Iranian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iran)__  embassy spokesman said on Wednesday.

__[Banisadr](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abulhassan_Banisadr)__  angered __[Tehran](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iran)__  last week by accusing top __[Iranian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iran)__  leaders of ordering the assassination of __[Iranian Kurdish](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iranian_Kurdistan)__  leaders in a __[Berlin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berlin)__  restaurant in 1992.

He made the allegations at the trial of an __[Iranian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iran)__  and four __[Lebanese](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lebanon)__  accused of carrying out the attack.

An __[Iranian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iran)__  embassy spokesman said in response to an inquiry that __[Iran](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iran)__  had formally requested __[Banisadr](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abulhassan_Banisadr)__ 's extradition for hijacking the military aircraft which he commandeered to flee __[Iran](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iran)__  in July 1981.

"We submitted the request three or four days ago," he said.

__[German](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germany)__  authorities could not immediately be reached for comment.

__[Banisadr](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abulhassan_Banisadr)__  lives under round-the-clock security in __[France](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/France)__ , fearing __[Tehran](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iran)__  could make an attempt on his life.

He is due back in __[Berlin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berlin)__  on September 5 to continue his testimony, which has backed up __[German](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germany)__  prosecutors' allegations that __[Tehran](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iran)__  ordered the attack on the exiled leaders.

Three dissidents and their translator were killed in the gangland-style machinegun attack.

__[Iran](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iran)__  has warned __[Germany](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germany)__  that bilateral relations could suffer if it pays heed to the testimony of __[Banisadr](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abulhassan_Banisadr)__ , an architect of __[Iran](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iran)__ 's __[Islamic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islam)__  revolution who has been a sworn enemy of __[Tehran](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iran)__
