From there it follows a curved path west of the __[South Branch Raritan River](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Branch_Raritan_River)__  until it meets with the Musconetcongs.  It is generally unmarred as a plateau, excluding some of the small valleys of tributaries along the Delaware, of Lopatcong Creek and __[Wickecheoke Creek](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wickecheoke_Creek)__  and Cakepoulin/Capoolong Creek Valley.  Other features are Thatcher's Hill and Sand Hill which form southeastward extensions to the plateau due to a valley of Walnut Brook and the curve of the plateau there.

__Cave_Rock_Tunnel__

The Cave Rock Tunnel is a dual bore highway tunnel on __[U.S. Route 50](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U.S._Route_50_in_Nevada)__  (US&nbsp;50) along the eastern shore of __[Lake Tahoe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lake_Tahoe)__  approximately seven miles (11.4&nbsp;km) north of __[Stateline](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stateline,_Nevada)__ , in __[Douglas County](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Douglas_County,_Nevada)__ , __[Nevada](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nevada)__ , . To the __[Washoe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washoe_people)__  Indian Tribe, Cave Rock is considered a sacred place and the tribe has placed restrictions on recreational activities in the vicinity of the tunnel.

The tunnels carry  through Cave Rock, a mountain along the eastern shore of __[Lake Tahoe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lake_Tahoe)__ .  There are numerous small caves adjacent to the south portal of both tunnels which give the rock its name. The tunnel is located between the towns of __[Zephyr Cove](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zephyr_Cove,_Nevada)__  and __[Glenbrook](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glenbrook,_Nevada)__  along the US&nbsp;50 corridor. This portion of US&nbsp;50 is a __[National Scenic Byway](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Scenic_Byway)__ , part of the . The westbound bore is  long and features exposed rock; the eastbound bore features a concrete liner and is  long. The tunnels are an elevation of at approximately , about  above the level of the lake.

The tunnel dates back to the __[Lincoln Highway](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lincoln_Highway)__ . Originally the Lincoln Highway was routed along a single lane  and rock wall built in 1863. Recognizing the inadequacy of the single lane road, efforts began to improve capacity on the primary road to Lake Tahoe.  The first bore was constructed in 1931, as part of a reconstruction of a  section of the Lincoln Highway. Concerned about damaging Cave Rock, the project managers employed key people from the recently completed  in what is now __[Zion National Park](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zion_National_Park)__  in Utah. The first traffic began flowing through the bore in mid-September of that year. Construction on the second bore began in 1957, when US&nbsp;50 was widened to four lanes, at a cost of just over $450,000 (equivalent to  $ million today). Coincidentally, both bores were constructed by Utah based construction companies.

The Cave Rock area is considered sacred by the __[Washoe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washoe_people)__  tribe. The Washoe tribal leaders were not consulted about the construction of either bore, and were upset about the perceived desecration of their tribal lands. Within the last decade, the Washoe Tribe has had a larger influence on Cave Rock and its historic preservation. In 2007, the Federal Government ruled on a precedent-setting case that has restricted activities around the tunnel, such as __[rock climbing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rock_climbing)__

__Nucleoid__

The nucleoid (meaning __[nucleus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_nucleus)__ -like) is an irregularly-shaped region within the __[cell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology))__  of a __[prokaryote](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prokaryote)__  that contains all or most of the __[genetic material](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genome)__ .  In contrast to the __[nucleus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_nucleus)__  of a __[eukaryotic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eukaryote)__  cell, it is not surrounded by a __[nuclear membrane](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_membrane)__ . The __[genome](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genome)__  of prokaryotic organisms generally is a circular, double-stranded piece of __[DNA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNA)__ , of which multiple copies may exist at any time. The length of a genome widely varies, but generally is at least a few million base pairs.

A genophore is the DNA of a prokaryote. It is commonly referred to as a prokaryotic __[chromosome](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chromosome)__ . The term "chromosome" is misleading for a genophore because the genophore lacks __[chromatin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chromatin)__ . The genophore is compacted through a mechanism known as , whereas a chromosome is additionally compacted via chromatin.  The genophore is circular in most prokaryotes, and linear in very few. The circular nature of the genophore allows replication to occur without . Genophores are generally of a much smaller size than Eukaryotic chromosomes. A genophore can be as small as 580,073 base pairs (__[Mycoplasma genitalium](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mycoplasma_genitalium)__ ). Many eukaryotes (such as plants and animals) carry genophores in organelles such as  and . These organelles are very similar to true prokaryotes.

The nucleoid can be clearly visualized on an  at high __[magnification](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnification)__ , where, although its appearance may differ, it is clearly visible against the __[cytosol](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cytosol)__ . Sometimes even strands of what is thought to be DNA are visible. By staining with the __[Feulgen stain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feulgen_stain)__ , which specifically stains DNA, the nucleoid can also be seen under a light microscope. The DNA-intercalating stains __[DAPI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DAPI)__  and __[ethidium bromide](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethidium_bromide)__  are widely used for  of nucleoids.

Experimental evidence suggests that the nucleoid is largely composed of DNA, about 60%, with a small amount of __[RNA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RNA)__  and __[protein](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein)__ . The latter two constituents are likely to be mainly __[messenger RNA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Messenger_RNA)__  and the __[transcription factor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transcription_factor)__  proteins found regulating the bacterial genome. Proteins helping to maintain the supercoiled structure of the nucleic acid are known as nucleoid proteins or nucleoid-associated proteins and are distinct from __[histone](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Histone)__

__Vijaya_Dasa__

Vijaya Dasa () (1682–1755) (or Sri Vijaya Dasa) was a prominent saint from the __[Haridasa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haridasa)__  tradition of __[Karnataka](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karnataka)__ , __[India](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India)__  in the 18th century, and a scholar of the __[Dvaita](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dvaita)__  philosophical tradition. Along with contemporary haridasa saints such as Gopala Dasa, Helevankatte Giriamma, __[Jagannatha Dasa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jagannatha_Dasa)__  and Prasanna Venkata Dasa, he propagated the virtues of the philosophy of  across South India through devotional songs called devaranama written in the __[Kannada language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kannada_language)__ . An integral part of Kannada  devotional literature, these compositions in praise of the Hindu god __[Vishnu](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vishnu)__  are called dasara padagalu (compositions of the dasas). These compositions can be more specifically categorized as keertanas, suladis,ugabhogas, and simply padas. They were easy to sing to the accompaniment of a musical instrument and dealt with __[bhakti](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bhakti)__  (devotion) and the virtues of a pious life.

__Panhandle__

A panhandle is an American informal __[geographic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Political_geography)__  term for an elongated arm-like protrusion of a geo-political entity, such as a  or a __[sovereign state](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sovereign_state)__ .
