  __[Bandar Seri Begawan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bandar_Seri_Begawan)__  11-15 (__[AFP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agence_France-Presse)__ ) -  A high-level American official announced today Wednesday in the wake of the meeting between American President Bill Clinton and his Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin that Putin's proposals on reducing the Russian and American nuclear capability to under 1500 nuclear heads does not include "many new elements."   The official who wished to remain anonymous confirmed "we have paid a great deal of attention to President Putin's announcement but it does not contain many new elements, in fact just a few new disparities which require further examination and discussion by experts."   Clinton and Putin are taking part in the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) forum in Bandar Seri Begawan the capital of the __[Sultanate of Brunei](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brunei)__ .  The presidents met for a working lunch of around 75 minutes.   The American official stressed that what is important in Putin's proposal is that it falls within the "framework adopted by the United States and Russia to discuss strategic issues from a defensive and offensive point of view."   Putin proposed limiting the Russian and American nuclear capabilities by reducing the number of nuclear heads to under 1500 each, a smaller number than that in the Russian-American Start-3 treaty currently being negotiated.  He proposed that the current reduction should be between 2500 to 2000 nuclear heads.   Putin said this reduction would depend on compliance with the Russian-American anti-ABM missile treaty signed in 1972, which the Americans are attempting to amend to set up anti- missile defenses (NMD).   Washington has so far confirmed agreeing to the 2000 to 2500 nuclear warhead ceiling.  The United States has not taken a final position on the NMD system because Clinton, whose term ends in January, is leaving the decision in this matter to his successor.   In response to a question about Republican presidential candidate George Bush Junior's approach to deploying the NMD system, more ambitious than the one proposed by the Clinton administration, the American official said the United States would continue "complying with the present framework" in these strategic discussions.   He added "while this framework does not reflect the basic interests of the United States, we feel it is still a valid approach in our discussions with Russia on this matter."   He also said that Clinton raised the issue of the transfer of sensitive Russian technology to __[Iran](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iran)__

 Welcome to this hour of VOA News Now. I'm Erin Brumett in __[Washington](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington,_D.C.)__ . The incredibly close Florida vote count for President is in the state courts and heading for the US __[Supreme Court](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supreme_Court_of_the_United_States)__  at the end of the week. That's virtually unprecedented, as the Federal Courts have tended to stay out of elections, which are the responsibility of the states. __[Joe O'Grossman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joel_Grossman)__  is a professor of constitutional law at __[Baltimore](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baltimore)__ 's __[Johns Hopkins University](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Johns_Hopkins_University)__ . He says that in this instance the Supreme Court probably felt the circumstances were such that they had no real alternative but to take the case.   Well, I think they took the case because it seemed like it was such a important issue that it would be kind of unseemly for them to try to reject it out of hand. In fact, I think that __[Lawrence Tribe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laurence_Tribe)__ , the Harvard Law School Professor who is arguing for __[Gore](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Al_Gore)__  tomorrow, is going to ask the court to hold the case, moot and dismiss it. And the Bush campaign has brought the case, but recognizes that the particular issues that they brought to the court last week are really not very relevant anymore. They are going to probably, well, I know what they are going to do. They are going to try to broaden the case to make it a kind of a general referendum on election procedures. So, they are looking for a coronation. And the Gore people at this point just want to get rid of this case, because they think they have a better chance in the Florida courts.   Republicans generally support states' rights. So, does it appear somewhat ironic that they are going to the Supreme Court in this instance?   No, I think first of all the notion that Republicans favor states' rights and Democrats oppose it, is much too simplistic. That's generally true, but it's only true on some issues. And in this case, you could argue that the Bush people are going to the Supreme Court to preserve the right of Florida, to determine its own electors. So, there is a kind of states' rights issue there. But they need, or at least they once thought they needed the Supreme Court to endorse it. So it goes both ways.   What are the justices likely looking for?   Well, I don't know. But I think that - and I think they will be divided, I mean I don't think they will be unanimous. Obviously, they would like to be able to achieve some kind of resolution of the case. American election laws are often challenged at the local level and sometimes in the Federal courts, but this is certainly the first time we have had a Supreme Court challenge over presidential election. So, there is a lot of new law here to be made or at least law that hasn't been made yet. It's possible that if the court accepts the invitation of the Bush campaign, at least as it is expressed in the briefs they submitted yesterday, that the court will in the sense, take the entire issue, even - not just the specific questions that it was asked last week and try to resolve the question. For example, if the court says it is clearly the fact that the __[legislature](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florida_Legislature)__  of the state of Florida can determine for itself who its electors will be, that will pretty much end the case, because that's what the legislature already plans to do. And that doesn't mean the Gore people won't keep trying, because ultimately __[Congress](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Congress)__

  __[Jerusalem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jerusalem)__  7-15 (__[AFP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agence_France-Presse)__ ) -  A high level Israeli army official has said today Saturday that Israel believes __[Iran](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iran)__  is set to begin acquiring nuclear capability for military purposes from 2005 and will be in a position to equip missiles with nuclear warheads, capable of reaching Israel, within ten years.   The official, who wished to remain anonymous, told journalists: "Iran will start accumulating nuclear capability for military purposes from 2005 and will be in a position, within the space of 10 years, to produce nuclear warheads that can be fitted to missiles capable of striking Israel."   The official made these statements after Tehran announced today Saturday that it had "successfully" completed a new test on the Shahab 3 ground-ground missile with a range of 1300 kilometers.   The official further said: "Iran is not capable of developing a nuclear program without __[Moscow](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moscow)__ 's help."   He said that according to information obtained by Israel, tests on the Shahab 3 ground-ground missile were in fact "successful and reached their maximum range of 1300 kilometers which allows them to reach strategic centers in Israel."   The official said that the design of the Shahab missile is based on a North Korean missile called Nodong, itself developed from the Soviet Scud missile.   The official also stressed that Iran regards the "destruction of Israel as legitimate," saying that "Tehran is embroiled in strategic terrorist activities targeting Israel, especially alongside Palestinian and Lebanese organizations."   The official further considered that "the Shahab missile will not come into operation for two years and that an improved range of 2000 kilometers would only be achieved after this period."   Israel's Deputy Defense Minister, Ephraim Sneh, said today Saturday that Israel would "know how to find a suitable response" to the Iranian Shahab 3 ground-ground missile with a 1300 kilometer range.   Sneh said on army radio that "Israel will prepare itself to find a suitable response to this threat," without giving any further details.

The title-holding Saudi team suffered a bitter defeat (1-4) against its Japanese counterpart in its first match in the championship yesterday Saturday.   The __[Youth and Sports Bureau](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NIL)__  in Saudi Arabia released a statement saying: "Prince Sultan Ben Fahd, president of the Youth and Sports Bureau and president of the Saudi Soccer Federation, has issued a decision by order of which Czech coach Machala has been discharged and Nasser Jawhar has been placed in charge of training the team during the championship."   He carried on: "This decision is the result of the Saudi Federation ensuring the best technical conditions for the team in order to reflect the true level of Saudi soccer."   In a telephone call with Agence France Presse at his hotel, Machala refused to give his opinion regarding the decision and said "no comment."   Machala is the first victim of the 12th Asian Nations Cup finals hosted by __[Lebanon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lebanon)__  until this October 29 as the Japanese blow was fatal, especially since the Saudi team holds the title from the previous series in the __[Emirates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Arab_Emirates)__  in 1996.

Medical sources said "at least 15 Palestinians were injured by live bullets fired by Israeli soldiers, including six children all shot in the head."   Eyewitnesses said the clashes broke out when the Israeli army began bulldozing Palestinian land near the border with __[Egypt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Egypt)__  and opened fire randomly on Palestinian citizens when they threw stones at the soldiers in protest. An Israeli tank also fired a rocket.   Elsewhere, Israeli bulldozers dug up dozens of hectares of Palestinian farmland near the village of Alkarara (near the Kosovim checkpoint) last night for the second day in a row, destroying two houses and a well, where the army erected a new military camp instead.

The radio reported "senior political officials" as saying at the close of the security cabinet's meeting, chaired by Prime Minister Ehud Barak, that the army would continue with the procedure it has followed over the past days and that there would be no escalation.   Military officials who also attended the meeting that Palestinian President Yasser Arafat "wants to drag Israel into an escalation which would lead to international intervention."   The head of the prime minister's office, Jalaad Shir, had previously said on official television that "a compromise must be found between a studied response not leading to escalation and the need to pave the way for political openness, on the condition that the Palestinians resolutely stop the violence and incitement to violence."   Shir added "only then will it be possible to think about resuming the political process and on what basis."   The security cabinet was convened to a session with the aim of examining new measures to deal with the escalation in attacks against Israelis in the West Bank and Gaza Strip.

 &UR; By JAMES DAO &LR; &QC; &QL; &UR; c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service &LR; &QC; &QL;    __[WASHINGTON](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington,_D.C.)__  _ __[Ralph Nader](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ralph_Nader)__  may not be feeling any regrets about his Green Party presidential campaign, but some visitors to the chat room on Nader2000.org, Nader's official campaign website, sounded as if a bad hangover had come crashing down on them.   There was this entry, for instance, posted Thursday morning by a writer named ``wreckz'':   ``I, too, feel I should apologize to __[America](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States)__ . I was duped. Ralph Nader's enjoyment of all of this is an indication of a man more concerned with vindictive politics than the future of our country and planet. I am no longer a member of the Green Party. Instead, I'm a member of the green movement _ a movement without Ralph Nader.''   Or this one, also posted Thursday morning, from ``__[Noni](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NIL)__ '':   ``I saw an interview with Ralph Nader today and he seemed to be enjoying what has happened! I've never seen him smile so broadly. I regret my support. Nader, you're a well-intending man and I agree with most of your positions. But the symbolic run for the __[White House](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_House)__  has destroyed our Party and our cause. Very bad things are in our future. You should not be smiling. And we, the misled, should feel shame for what we've done.''   The remarks expressed fears that votes for Nader may have put Gov. George W. Bush in a position to defeat Vice President Al Gore. In __[Florida](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florida)__ , where Gore trailed Bush by only a few hundred votes Thursday, a shift of just a fraction of Nader's 95,000 votes could have given the state, and the White House, to Gore, the most likely major-party alternative for Nader's supporters.   __[John Ruth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NIL)__ , for example, wrote on the Nader2000 site Thursday morning that he voted for Nader because he thought they ``shared a common goal'' but that he was now regretting it.   `` Gore (despite what you have said) is NOT an environmental clone of G.W. Bush. Because of your actions and statements prior to Nov. 7th, we are on the brink of a Bush presidency. No money, no support, no respect for you, Ralph, ever again!''   And in __[Oregon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oregon)__ , a state that was still too close to call Thursday afternoon, Nader won about 5 percent of the vote _ enough to cause some Nader voters to feel morning-after qualms.   __[Julie Quastler](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NIL)__ , 28, who voted for Nader in __[Portland](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portland,_Oregon)__ , said on Wednesday that she was feeling ``a little alarmed and disappointed'' that Bush seemed on the brink of winning the presidency _ suggesting that she did not accept Nader's assertion that the two parties were equally bad.   ``I'm just so sad,'' she said. ``Bush is probably going to be our president and Nader didn't get his 5 percent. It seems like a lose-lose end result in some ways.'' Winning 5 percent of the vote nationwide would have qualified the Green Party for millions of dollars in federal campaign funds in 2004.   But Quastler, the development director for a nonprofit cafe, said she did not feel guilty about her vote.   ``I voted for Nader because he was most aligned with my values,'' she said.   Of course, there were also countless verbal high-fives among Nader supporters Thursday who felt the Green Party had sent a bracing wake-up call to the two major parties.   ``Stand tall and proud, fellow Nader supporters,'' said one message on the Nader2000 site signed GO LOOK ELSEWHERE FOR SCAPEGOATS.   ``We fought the good fight for what we believed in. This does not make us villains.''   Such sentiments seemed particularly strong in Florida. __[Dorothy Byrne](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NIL)__ , a state coordinator for the Florida __[Green Party](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Green_Party_of_Florida)__ , said she had been inundated with angry phone calls and e-mails from Democrats, but has yet to receive one regretful note from a Nader voter.   ``I can see positives for the Greens with either Bush or Gore being president,'' she said. ``If Gore was in, we wouldn't have to worry about women's reproductive rights. But his record on the environment is so abysmal I don't see how Bush can be any worse.''   __[Barbara Lange](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NIL)__ , the Everglades chairwoman for the Florida chapter of the __[Sierra Club](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sierra_Club)__ , said she and other environmentalists voted for Nader because Gore had not taken a stand against the development of a commercial airport near the Everglades.   ``I voted my conscience,'' she said. ``And I'm okay with that.''   __[Patricia Newell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NIL)__ , an organizer for Nader at the __[University of Florida](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Florida)__  in __[Gainesville](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gainesville,_Florida)__

Times News Service &LR; &QC; &QL;    __[TALLAHASSEE](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tallahassee,_Florida)__ , __[Fla.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florida)__  _ Lawyers for Vice President Al Gore said Wednesday their only chance for victory in his contest of the Florida election would be shattered if they have to wait until Saturday to begin counting disputed ballots, and they began an appeal to the Florida __[Supreme Court](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supreme_Court_of_Florida)__  to do the counting itself, immediately.   The appeal was filed with the __[District Court of Appeal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florida_District_Courts_of_Appeal)__  late Wednesday afternoon, and will be submitted to the state's highest court early Thursday, Gore's lawyers said. It essentially asks the Supreme Court to take over Gore's contest lawsuit from the slow-moving trial court, to count the ballots itself, and eventually to declare Gore the winner if he wins the recount.   But lawyers for Gov. George W. Bush said they had no intention of allowing any hand counting to begin without a vigorous legal fight. To that end, they persuaded Circuit Judge N. Sanders Sauls to order 1.1 million ballots _ every vote cast in Miami-Dade and Palm Beach counties _ brought up from south Florida and placed in the court's custody.   That represents 83 times the number of disputed ballots that the judge had agreed on Tuesday to transport to Tallahassee at the Gore team's request. And it could take weeks if not months to count them all, the point that __[Barry Richard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NIL)__ , Bush's chief trial lawyer here, said he was trying to make in requesting that the ballots be transported here.   ``We did it to make a point,'' Richard said in an interview. ``If you recount any ballots, you have to recount all of them. Now, we don't think any ballots should be counted, because the manual recount of ballots is finished. But in the event the court determines that some ballots should be counted, we wanted them here so they could all be counted.''   Aware that they could not stop the movement of all the ballots, Gore's lawyers barely objected to the move, asking only that the disputed ballots that might contain hidden Gore votes be separated from the mass.   ``I know when it's futile,'' said David Boies, Gore's chief trial lawyer, to Sauls.   Nonetheless, Gore's lawyers were furious at the move, aware that it represents yet another enormous barrier to their hopes for an immediate count of the 14,000 disputed ballots in the two counties and a quick decision from the judge that Gore really won the election. Even if the Florida Supreme Court should swiftly agree to their request and orders the counting to begin by Friday, that would still put them three days behind their original timetable. And facing a Dec. 12 deadline for the state to name electors for the __[Electoral College](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electoral_College_(United_States))__ , Gore has absolutely no days to spare.   ``It's a stunt,'' said __[Kendall Coffey](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NIL)__

Coal, water, oil, etc., are normally used for traditional electricity generation.  However, using liquefied natural gas as fuel for joint circulatory electricity generation has advantages of higher power generation efficiency and lower total cost, is beneficial to the environment, etc.  According to presentations, with this type of electricity generation method, a single engine with liquefied natural gas as fuel can produce waste gas with temperatures being as high as 500 to 600 degrees centigrade. This gas in turn can heat a boiler for the production of steam to turn a steam turbine which generates electricity.  Because of the efficiency of this construction method, the electricity generated is relatively competitive in price.  At the same time, using natural gas as fuel will also reduce environmental pollution along coastal regions.   The Weir Group, whose headquarters is in the US, is a large, specialized corporation investing in the area of electricity generation.  The installed capacity of electricity it has invested in and developed globally has reached 15 million kilowatts.  Through the contact of the __[Yizhong Company](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NIL)__  of the US, the Weir Group and the Jiangsu Electric Power Department reached an initial agreement on a plan to build a joint circulatory electricity generation plant.  This power plant, which will be situated in __[Rudong](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rudong_County)__ , Jiangsu, has an annual generation capacity of 2.4 million kilowatts. The investment amount is 2.4 billion US dollars. The Chinese side holds 30% of the shares while the Weir Group holds 70%.  According to the agreement, the Weir Group will be responsible for the supply of natural gas from the international market for use by the power plant.   __[Renzu Luo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NIL)__ , managing director of the Weir Group, is optimistic over the prospect of using liquefied natural gas as fuel for electricity generation along China's coastal regions.  He holds that according to the experience of Asian energy market development, liquefied natural gas has become the main material of clean fuel used for electricity generation. When the gross national product per capita reached 3000 US dollars in __[Japan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japan)__ , __[South Korea](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Korea)__  and __[Taiwan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taiwan)__ , etc., environmental protection awareness generally rose, and all began to obviously increase usage of electricity generated by liquefied natural gas.  As the gross national product in China's coastal regions begins to approach this benchmark, it can be said to have had the conditions for electricity generation using natural gas in terms of financial resources.   __[John Weir](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NIL)__ , president of the Weir Group who visited China with US Minister __[Brown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NIL)__

 &UR; c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service &LR; &QC; &QL;    __[GROSSE POINTE PARK](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grosse_Pointe_Park,_Michigan)__ , __[Mich.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michigan)__  _ It is deer hunting season in Michigan, and hunters who climb trees with loaded shotguns have state officials redoubling safety education efforts.   Two men have been killed, and a third has been injured since the hunting season opened on Nov. 15. All three accidents involved shotguns, elevated platforms and a practice relatively new to Michigan hunters _ shooting at deer from trees. The Michigan season, one of the busiest, continues through Nov. 30.   Firearm hunting from elevated platforms has long been legal in other states with heavy hunting, like __[New York](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York)__  and __[Pennsylvania](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pennsylvania)__ . But the practice is only in its third season in Michigan, and officials say it appears that hunters still have a lot to learn about safety. Lt. Suzanne Koppelo, hunter safety administrator of the law enforcement division of the Michigan __[Department of Natural Resources](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michigan_Department_of_Natural_Resources)__  &UR; , &LR; said that since firearm platform hunting began in Michigan there had been seven shooting accidents linked to the practice. Three were fatal. Two hunters shot themselves on platforms and another was killed on the ground by a hunter shooting from a platform. ``If hunters exercised the kind of caution one would expect at heights of 20-some feet, it would be almost a nonissue,'' said Koppelo. ``But given human nature, that's not the case.''   More than 750,000 licensed hunters are taking to the Michigan woods this year, where they are expected to kill about 500,000 of the state's 1.9 million deer. The numbers reinforce the need to improve education about platform hunting with firearms, Koppelo said.   The practice is more commonly associated with hunters using bows and arrows. Instead of hiding on the ground or walking through the woods, they wait quietly, typically at a height of 15 to 20 feet, and fire down at deer that wander below.   Despite the hunter killed from the platform, Sgt. Larry D. Sargent, hunter education field coordinator for the law enforcement division, says the practice does offer one safety advantage: errant shots typically thump harmlessly to the ground, rather than whistling through the woods and striking other people.   The problems primarily arise when hunters get in and out of position.   ``It's kind of hard climbing a tree with a gun,'' __[Rob Williams](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NIL)__  said, as he and a hunting partner, Art Bush, waited on a recent morning in a conventional earthbound hunting blind about 20 miles west of __[Detroit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Detroit)__ .   For Williams, Rule No. 1 is not to climb a tree with a loaded gun. He says that when he hunts from a platform he climbs up with a rope dangling from his belt to his gun, which he leaves unloaded on the ground. When he is secure in his stand, he pulls his gun up after him and loads it. Sargent says this is proper procedure.   One accident this year, however, illustrates the importance of following each step of the safety procedures. A 16-year-old hunter used a haul line, but it was tied to the trigger guard and he left the gun loaded, Koppelo said. The teen-ager's gun went off and he was shot in the foot.   Others are hurt falling out of trees. Koppelo said that state officials were trying to keep count of these injuries but that it was difficult, since they relied on hunters reporting minor accidents.   ``A lot of guys are embarrassed,'' Sargent said. ``They'll say they fell working in the yard or something.''   Others, Koppelo says, do not want to report accidents for fear the law will be changed. And she adds that though anecdotal reports show Michigan's large hunting population to be taking slowly to firearm deer hunting from platforms, most expect the practice to catch on as it has in other states.

Times News Service &QC; &LR; &QL;    __[CHATTANOOGA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chattanooga,_Tennessee)__ , __[Tenn.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tennessee)__  _ Nearly 17 months after he first issued his call for a ``fresh start after a season of cynicism,'' Gov. George W. Bush ended his quest for the presidency Monday on a nearly identical note, pledging to purge __[Washington](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington,_D.C.)__  of what he cast as a crippling discord.   The course that Bush charted over his final hours on the campaign trail, plotted with as much concern for symbolism as for raw electoral arithmetic, left no doubt about where he placed the blame for that atmosphere. His first major rally was in Tennessee and his last was planned for __[Arkansas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arkansas)__ , the home states, respectively, of Vice President Al Gore and President Clinton.   The Texas governor's words made equally clear that he saw himself as the country's best hope for bridging ideological divides, healing partisan wounds and making sure that Americans could gaze upon the __[White House](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_House)__  with unfettered respect.   ``There's a better day ahead if we have a leader who's willing to unite the country, to bring people together, to elevate the people's business above everyday politics,'' Bush said at a rally inside a hangar at the airport here, where supporters' chants evoked the nearness of the moment of decision.   ``One more day!'' they roared. ``One more day!''   What the nation needed, Bush told them, was ``a president who can unite this nation, a president who puts aside the endless partisan bickering that seems to gridlock our nation's capitol, a president who puts the people first, a president who lifts this nation's spirits.   ``I'll be that president,'' he added, a sentence that was equal parts promise and prediction. It underscored the optimism that Bush has, from the very beginning, sought to project to voters.   His schedule over the course of a 16-hour day was also an expression of that confidence.   In between Tennessee and Arkansas, his campaign plane touched down in __[Wisconsin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wisconsin)__  and __[Iowa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iowa)__ , and while any one of those four states could wind up providing the key to a Bush victory, none have as many electoral votes as such battlegrounds as __[Michigan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michigan)__  and __[Pennsylvania](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pennsylvania)__ .   But they are genuine tossups that were initially predicted to be much more hospitable to Gore. By visiting them Monday, Bush emphasized the breadth of his appeal and the sometimes surprising vulnerability of the vice president.   He did not let his assertion of strength and confidence distract him from the important business of beseeching supporters to grant him victory. With just 24 hours before Election Day, Bush in many ways stripped campaigning to its essence: coaxing and cajoling, pleading and persuading.   ``I want you to understand that I can't win without you,'' Bush told a crowd of more than 1,000 people at a convention center in __[Green Bay](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Green_Bay,_Wisconsin)__ , Wis. ``I hope you redouble your efforts to make sure people get out to the polls.''   Minutes later, he added: ``When you go out there and tell the folks where we stand on the issues and where we stand when it comes to bringing people together to get things done, and you tell them that the core of this campaign is the inherent trust in the American people, I believe it doesn't matter what political party they're in. They're going to come our way.''   In Chattanooga, Bush repeatedly needled Gore, which was much of the point of going to Tennessee, where Gore is not at all certain to prevail on Tuesday.   The Texas governor claimed that Gore's decades of experience in Washington had estranged him from the rest of the country by making him too trusting of federal government and too fond of federal spending.   ``My opponent vows to carry his home state,'' Bush said. ``He may win Washington, __[D.C.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington,_D.C.)__

Times News Service &QC; &LR; &QL;    Booking Your Ticket:   _ Fly nonstop. The fewer connections you make, the lower the chance that you will suffer a delay.   _ Pick airports with care. If you have to connect, choose the least-congested airport possible; some airports, like __[Chicago O'Hare](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/O'Hare_International_Airport)__  and __[La Guardia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LaGuardia_Airport)__  in __[New York](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_City)__ , experience chronic delays. Take into consideration the weather and the season; an airport in the __[South](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southern_United_States)__  might have fewer winter snowstorms but more spring and summer thunderstorms.   _ Check times between connecting flights. Airlines often book tight connections and do not take responsibility if you miss yours. Assume each leg of your flight will arrive late, and book connections that allow ample time.   _ Check on-time records. The __[Transportation Department](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Department_of_Transportation)__  requires major domestic airlines to make the on-time record for every flight available to consumers. You can check online at www.dot.gov/airconsumer. That site also reports each airline's on-time record for the previous month.   _ Travel on off-peak days and at off-peak times. Saturday is usually the least-traveled day of the week; so are major holidays. Monday mornings and Friday afternoons are peak travel times for business travelers. Flights leaving earlier in the day are less likely to be delayed, because of the cascading effect that disruptions have on airline schedules.   _ Use smaller airports. Instead of __[Los Angeles International](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles_International_Airport)__ , for example, consider flying into __[Burbank](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bob_Hope_Airport)__  or __[John Wayne Airport](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Wayne_Airport)__  in __[Orange County](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orange_County,_California)__ , __[Calif](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California)__ ., or use __[Westchester County Airport](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Westchester_County_Airport)__  instead of __[JFK](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_F._Kennedy_International_Airport)__  in New York.   _ Avoid electronic tickets. Though they are convenient and more secure than an easily lost paper ticket, they are not transferable between most airlines if you need to switch carriers because of delays.   _ Watch for labor disruptions. Check newspapers and Web sites like www.thenewfoundlandgroup.com to identify airlines experiencing labor strife, which often increases cancellations and delays.   _ Leave a number. Make sure the airline you book with has a phone number at which you can be notified of delays or cancellations.   _ Use a travel agent. A good one can be a great ally in the event of a problem _ and may save you time and money.   Day of Departure:   _ Be informed. Check your flight's status before heading to the airport. Automated telephone services or airline Web sites often provide more up-to-date information than do ticket agents. The __[Federal Aviation Administration](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Aviation_Administration)__ 's Web site, www.fly.faa.gov, has real-time information on operations at the biggest airports.   _ Pack defensively. Take along a change of clothes and a toothbrush in your carry-on bag. If traveling with an infant, take 24 hours' worth of diapers and extra formula. When possible, avoid checking luggage, in case you need to switch flights or carriers. Ship your gifts ahead.   _ Educate yourself. Find out what your airline promises to do for passengers in the event of a delay. Print out a copy of the policy from the airline's Web site, and carry it with you _ in case the airline representatives need a reminder.   If a Flight Is Delayed:   _ Keep your cool. Becoming angry at airline personnel is counterproductive. Sympathy for their plight will sometimes produce results.   _ Don't stand in line. To get on another flight, it is often more effective to call the airline from the airport than to wait at the ticket counter. Carry a cell phone; if delays are widespread, public telephones may be in demand.   _ Check the competition. If another airline has seats to your destination, ask your airline to endorse your ticket to the other line.   _ Get what you paid for. If you paid full fare or are a high-mileage frequent flier, let the airline know. Your odds of getting a seat on the next flight out will increase, or the airline might pay for your hotel, if you are delayed overnight.   _ Consider driving. If the last leg of your flight is a 200-mile hop, renting a car might be a better choice than waiting out a delay.   Getting Even:   _ Write a letter. The airlines have pledged to respond to consumer complaints within 60 days. They almost always offer a refund, reimbursement of expenses, a discount on your next ticket _ or all three. Be sure to save the relevant paperwork.   _ Make it a federal case. Send a copy of your letter to __[Washington](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington,_D.C.)__ .

 MERGER &QL; By ALEX BERENSON &QC; &LR; &QL; &UR; c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service &QC; &LR; &QL; &UR; &LR; Back in January, when Internet stocks were hot, America Online agreed to buy Time Warner with AOL stock. The deal, if approved by regulators, would leave AOL shareholders with 55 percent of the merged company, even though Time Warner's revenue and cash flow are far greater.    Since then, AOL's stock has fallen by almost a third, destroying most of the premium the company had offered for control of __[Time Warner](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_Warner)__ . So a Time Warner shareholder might conclude that America Online's chairman, Stephen Case, had bamboozled his Time Warner counterpart, Gerald Levin, into taking AOL's shares at the worst possible time.   ``Short term, anyone objective would say probably Steve got the better part of the deal,'' said __[Larry Haverty](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NIL)__ , a senior vice president at __[State Street Research](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_Street_Corporation)__  in __[Boston](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston)__  and a longtime media investor.   But Haverty, like many other Time Warner shareholders and industry analysts, hardly cares. With the merger likely to be completed later this month, he predicts that the merged company will grow quickly by combining AOL's marketing skills and captive base of online users with Time Warner's huge library of films, magazines and the like and its relationships with major advertisers.   ``The deal strategically and financially makes all the sense in the world,'' Haverty said. ``Five years out, if you're a shareholder in this company, you're going to be a happy camper.''   That view is widely shared. ``Strategically, it makes a lot of sense,'' said __[Tom Wolzien](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NIL)__  of __[Sanford C. Bernstein](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sanford_Bernstein)__ . ``These companies fill the holes of the other one. They're subscription-advertising combo models. The reality is the pieces are very compatible.''   To be sure, the recent history of big media mergers is hardly comforting for shareholders in either AOL or Time Warner. __[Disney](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Walt_Disney_Company)__  stumbled badly after it bought __[Capital Cities/ABC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capital_Cities_Communications)__  in 1996, and Time Warner stagnated for five years after it was created in 1990 by the merger of __[Time](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_Inc.)__  and __[Warner](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warner_Communications)__ . ``Huge deals are really hard to do and create a lot of uncertainty,'' said __[Roger McNamee](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roger_McNamee)__  of __[Integral Capital](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NIL)__ , which sold its 404,000 AOL shares the day the merger was announced.   But if the merged company can overcome that hurdle, it will have big advantages over Disney and other traditional media companies, which are still struggling to figure out how they can profit from the Internet, said __[Jessica Reif](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NIL)__  of __[Merrill Lynch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merrill_Lynch)__ .   ``Given the multiple distribution platforms that they have, it's obviously a very powerful consumer engine,'' Reif said. ``There's a reason that you see Disney and to a lesser extent __[NBC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBC)__  screaming in __[Washington](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington,_D.C.)__ .''   __[John Schreiber](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NIL)__ , an assistant portfolio manager at __[Janus Capital](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Janus_Capital_Group)__ , the mutual fund company that is Time Warner's largest shareholder, with more than 120 million shares, said the companies had already begun to demonstrate how they would work together. For example, AOL has pitched Time Warner's magazines to its users, resulting in hundreds of thousands of new subscriptions. And the companies are trying to sell big advertisers on deals that will reach both America Online users and the people who watch Time Warner cable channels and read its magazines, Schreiber said.   ``Once the merger closes, I think you'll see some very powerful cross-promotional deals across all of Time Warner's advertisers,'' he said.   Schreiber also says the risk of cultural clashes between the companies is limited, because the companies disclosed publicly where top executives would stand in the combined company only a few weeks after the merger was announced. So people who feel their responsibilities have been diminished have had months to look for new jobs, and some have already left, he said.   Given the strength he sees in the combined company, Schreiber said the question of whether Levin could have negotiated a better deal with America Online is moot.

  __[Camp Zeist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zeist)__  (__[Holland](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holland)__ ) 11-15 (__[AFP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agence_France-Presse)__ ) -  Today Wednesday, the judges in charge of looking into the Lockerbie case in Camp Zeist (Holland) were faced with an awkward problem: how to deal with a witness who is refusing to answer questions and who is at the same time serving a life sentence and who is not subject to Scottish law?   The problem arose after Palestinian Mahmood Abu Talib, whose testimony the court has been hearing since Friday, refused to continue answering a question by defense lawyer Richard Keen about the detailed reasons for his having lived in the former __[Soviet Union](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soviet_Union)__  for a period of 18 months in the 70s.   The lawyer asked the judges to force Abu Talib to answer the question aimed at demonstrating the witness's "professional terrorism" precedents.   46-year-old Abu Talib was sentenced to life imprisonment in 1990 in __[Sweden](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sweden)__  for terrorist acts in __[Amsterdam](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amsterdam)__ , __[Copenhagen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copenhagen)__  and __[Stockholm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stockholm)__  between 1985 and 1986. The defense council in the Lockerbie court is attempting to show his involvement in the Lockerbie attack.   Based on Scottish law, followed in this court, if Abu Talib insists on not responding to the question, this is considered to be "contempt of court" and means he may be punished in accordance with Scottish law covering such incidents.   The problem is that the judges may not punish Abu Talib unless Sweden hands him over to Scotland after the court case ends to apply the punishment for "contempt of court."   So far, the judges have not asked Abu Talib to answer the defense's question in what appears to be a move to avoid a tricky situation if the witness refuses to answer.   The court president, Ronald Sutherland, who adjourned the session for a short while in an attempt to find a solution to this dilemma, said "this raises an important question of principle."   The two Libyans, __[Alameen Khalifa Fahima](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lamin_Khalifah_Fhimah)__  and __[Abdulbasit al-Maqrahi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abdelbaset_al-Megrahi)__ , are suspected of sending a bomb from __[Malta](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malta)__
