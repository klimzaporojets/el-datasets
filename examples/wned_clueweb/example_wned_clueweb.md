READER QUESTION
I want to refinance our first mortgage, but the second mortgage holder won't subordinate. What can we do?
Read full question
We found a company that will refinance our first, but the second lien holder will not subordinate without a full appraisal. We have already paid them $150 and they won't return it even though they didn't do the subordination. What department within the second mortgage company would we write to request a loan rate reduction? If they refuse to reduce the interest rate, what other recourse would we have? Can we offer a settlement of 10 cents on the dollar? I noticed several other people in your comments have been able to do this. We live in __[Colorado](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colorado)__ .
Bills.com Resident Expert

BILL'S ANSWER
As part of its efforts to stimulate the __[US](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States)__  economy, the __[Federal Reserve](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Reserve_System)__  has lowered interest rates to record low levels in 2008 and 2009, which in part has allowed banks to offer some attractive rates to homeowners wishing to take out a new mortgage or refinance an existing loan.
Refinancing when the loan balances exceed the property value
Although many current homeowners would like to refinance their home loans to take advantage of the low interest rates, the downturn in property values has resulted in many owing second mortgages or home equity loans that push their total current financing perilously close to, if not over, the actual values of their homes. In this situation, a refinance lender is unlikely to loan the homeowner enough money to combine the first and second mortgages into a single obligation, as the lender does not want to extend a loan that exceeds the value of the property securing debt.
The refi lender may be willing to refinance the first mortgage, but only if the lender holding the second mortgage or home equity loan is willing to give the refi lender's encumbrance on the property seniority over the second mortgage.
Allow me to travel on a momentary tangent regarding legal terminology. In __[Colorado](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colorado)__ , __[California](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California)__ , __[Texas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Texas)__  and 18 other states the "mortgage" is actually a "deed of trust." Legally, the two are different, but a comparison of the two exceeds the scope of this discussion. Although it is inaccurate technically to call a __[Colorado](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colorado)__  home loan a mortgage, we will continue to refer to the first and second loan on the property here a mortgage because that is expected and understood by our non-property lawyer readers.
Subordination
Getting back to the subordination issue, without such an agreement, the second mortgage, as the older debt, would become the senior encumbrance on the property once the refi lender pays off the first mortgage as part of the refinance.
Unfortunately, unless you have a significant equity cushion, the bank holding your second mortgage loan is likely to refuse to agree to subordinate its encumbrance, especially if you are planning to "cash out" any of your equity by borrowing more from the refi lender than you currently owe on the first mortgage.
The secondary lender's position is already relatively weak in terms of its ability to enforce its security interest in the home, since it would be required to either pay off or otherwise receive the first mortgage lender's consent to proceed with foreclosure. Given its already tenuous ability to force repayment, the secondary lender is unlikely to agree to subordination to a "cash out" refi loan, which would eat up the small amount of equity to which it may be able to lay claim in case of default.
On the other hand, if you can show the second mortgage holder that the refi loan will actually reduce the risk of default on your home loans by reducing your total mortgage payments each month, you may find the secondary lender more willing to cooperate with you and the bank providing the refinance loan.
Consult with the agent handling your potential refinance loan, as well as any other mortgage professionals you know, to discuss the best way to present your plan to the second mortgage lender. The key is making the lender believe that the refinance loan and required subordination will ultimately serve its interests.
Appraisal by second mortgage company
In your question, you state that your second mortgage company has requested a full appraisal of your property before it will consider agreeing to subjugate its encumbrance to that of the company through which you are trying to refinance your first mortgage.
First, you should understand that demanding a complete appraisal of the home's value is not unusual. The second mortgage company wants to determine how much equity you currently have in the property (the more equity, the more likely junior encumbrances will be paid in case of foreclosure), and how the proposed refinance loan will affect this equity cushion. It will also want to determine if you are "upside-down" on the property (you owe more that the home is worth), as being in this position significantly increases the possibility that you will default on one or all of your mortgage obligations.
Here, it sounds like the lender has refused to subordinate, and refused to refund the appraisal fee paid. Unfortunately, I do not think that you have much recourse in this regard, as appraisal fees are usually non-refundable.
However, if you think that you were mislead by the lender, you may want to contact the Colorado Dept. of __[Real Estate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real_estate)__  and the __[Colorado](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colorado)__  Attorney General's Office to file complaints against the lender. While these agencies cannot guarantee you a favorable outcome, they are often successful in mediating disputes between consumers and businesses.
Loan modification
You are correct in pointing out that a Bills.com reader reported that a second mortgage holder made a lump-sum settlement with a homeowner for 10 cents on the dollar. Keep in mind that there are dozens of companies making second mortgage loans, and hundreds of thousands of second mortgages under contract. Your lender may not offer such attractive settlement terms.
As for what department at the second mortgage company you need to contact to discuss the possible modification of your loan terms (payment amount, interest rate, loan term, etc.), you should probably start by contacting the general customer service department. They may help you directly, but a good __[CS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Credit_Suisse)__  agent should be able to point you to the correct department (probably named something like "loss mitigation," though this will depend on your specific lender).
To read more about refinance loans, I invite you to visit the Bills.com home refinance page. I wish you the best of luck in your efforts to refinance your current mortgage loans, and hope that the information I have provided helps you Find. Learn. Save.
Best,
Bill

I have run into the situation whereby my Home Equity Lender will not re-subordinate and accomodate my refinance.
In this case my refinance will be a lower loan amount, a lower monthly payment and will convert an interest only loan to an amortizing loan.
I have also expressed the ability to slightly reduce my Home Equity Line.
The appraised value of the combined loans will be 80% and the original home equity loan was made at 86%.
Have you heard of anything so absurd?
Do you know of anyone attorney's taking on law suits in this instance.
Obvious damages would be lost equity of the term and the lossed opportunity to reduce monthly payments.

Green
is the Color of Poverty
A Message from Dick Rowland
It’s questionable whether or not various
initiatives pushed by the __[Green](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golf_course)__  lobby will actually do anything beneficial for
the environment. Less questionable is the negative effect their policies will have
on the world’s poor, who will remain poor if the radical environmentalists get
their way.
Even
something as seemingly innocuous as the “carbon offsets” favored by __[Al Gore](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Al_Gore)__  and
his ilk can end up keeping the __[Third World](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Third_World)__  in poverty. According to a recent
headline in the __[London Times](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Times)__ , “To cancel out the __[CO2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon_dioxide)__  of a return
flight to __[India](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India)__ , it will take one poor villager three years of pumping water by
foot. So is carbon offsetting the best way to ease your conscience?” Why use a
foot pump in the 21st century? Because for offsetting to work, poor people
worldwide have to continue using outdated, nonpolluting technology at the cost
of their own advancement and prosperity. Some have fairly called this
eco-enslavement. What else would you call it when some poor person on the other
side of the world has to work extra hard just so you don’t feel guilty about
your SUV?
This
special edition of GIR looks at the forgotten victims of the __[Green](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golf_course)__  agenda: the
world’s poor who are denied the benefits of the modern world by elites who
could care less about their well-being.
IN THE
NEWS - HIGHLIGHTED COMMENTARIES
__[Grassroot Institute](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grassroot_Institute)__  is
regularly featured in news articles and broadcasts around the state. Here is a
sample of some of our recent articles, research stories, and other articles of
interest.
Environmental Activists Are Enemies of the Poor
By Roy Innis
"__[People](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/People_(magazine))__  here have no jobs," Mark Fenn admitted, after taking
documentary producers on a tour of his $35,000 catamaran and the site of his new
coastal home. "But if you could count how many times they smile in a day, if you
could measure stress"--and compare that to "well-off people" in __[London](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London)__  or __[New York](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_City)__ --"then tell me, who is rich and who is poor?"
Fenn is coordinator of the __[World Wildlife Fund](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Wide_Fund_for_Nature)__ 's campaign against a proposed mining project near Fort Dauphin, __[Madagascar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Madagascar)__ . The locals strongly support the project and want the jobs, improved port, sustained development, and improved living standards and environmental quality this state-of-the-art operation will bring....
But Fenn claims the mine will change the "quaint" village and harm the environment. He says he feels "like a resident," his children "were born and raised" there, and the locals "don't consider education to be important" and would just spend their money on parties, jeans, and stereos.

Activists Hurt the World's Poor: An Interview with Paul Driessen
By James
M. Taylor
GRIH Senior Fellow __[Paul Driessen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Driessen_(lobbyist))__  is a warrior on the front lines of the battle against __[Third World poverty](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poverty)__  and disease.
As a senior policy advisor for the __[Congress of Racial Equality](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Congress_of_Racial_Equality)__  and a senior fellow with the __[Committee for a Constructive Tomorrow](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Committee_for_a_Constructive_Tomorrow)__ , __[Driessen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Driessen_(lobbyist))__  dedicates himself to identifying and eliminating the obstacles that keep people in underdeveloped countries from breaking through the abject poverty barrier.
All too often, __[Driessen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Driessen_(lobbyist))__  has discovered, the very environmental activist groups that claim to care so much about people in underdeveloped countries are the ones keeping them down.
James M. Taylor caught up with __[Driessen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Driessen_(lobbyist))__  for a discussion of __[Third World](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Third_World)__  nations and the environment.

Carl Sagan
Volume 17.1, Fall 1992
__[Isaac Asimov](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isaac_Asimov)__  was one of the great explainers of the age. Like __[TH Huxley](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Henry_Huxley)__ , he was motivated by profoundly democratic impulses to communicate science to the public. “__[Science](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Science)__  is too important,” he said, paraphrasing Clemenceau, “to be left to the scientists.” It will never be known how many practicing scientists today, in how many countries, owe their initial inspiration to a book, article, or short story by __[Isaac Asimov](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isaac_Asimov)__ —nor how many ordinary citizens are sympathetic to the scientific enterprise from the same cause. For example, __[Marvin Minsky](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marvin_Minsky)__  of __[MIT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Massachusetts_Institute_of_Technology)__ , one of the pioneers of artificial intelligence, was brought to his subject by __[Asimov](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isaac_Asimov)__ 's robot stories (initially conceived to illustrate human/robot partnerships and to counter the prevailing notion, going back to __[Frankenstein](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frankenstein)__ , of robots as necessarily malign). At a time when science fiction was mainly devoted to action and adventure, __[Asimov](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isaac_Asimov)__  introduced puzzle-solving schemes that taught science and thinking along the way.
A number of his phrases and ideas have insinuated themselves into the culture of science—for example, his spare description of the solar system as “four planets plus debris” and his notion of one day carrying icebergs from the rings of __[Saturn](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saturn)__  to the arid wastelands of __[Mars](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mars)__ . He wrote many science books for young people, and as editor of his own science-fiction magazine he made efforts to encourage young writers.
His output was prodigious, approaching 500 volumes, always in his characteristic straightforward, plain-speaking syntax. Part of the reason his __[Foundation series](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foundation_series)__  on the decline of a galactic empire worked so well is that it was based on a close reading of __[Gibbon's Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_History_of_the_Decline_and_Fall_of_the_Roman_Empire)__ : A principal theme was the effort to keep science alive as the __[Dark Ages](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dark_Ages_(historiography))__  rolled in.
__[Asimov](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isaac_Asimov)__  spoke out in favor of science and reason and against pseudoscience and superstition. He was not afraid to criticize the __[US](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States)__  government and was deeply committed to stabilizing world population growth.
The microscopic probe he described in his novel Fantastic Voyage—which could enter the human bloodstream and repair tissue damage—was, sadly, not yet available at the time of his death. As someone born in grinding poverty, and with a lifelong passion to write and explain, __[Asimov](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isaac_Asimov)__  by his own standards led a successful and happy life. In one of his last books he wrote: “My life has just about run its course and I don't really expect to live much longer.” However, he went on, his love for his wife, the psychiatrist __[Janet Jeppson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Janet_Asimov)__ , and hers for him, sustained him. “It's been a good life, and I am satisfied with it. So please don't worry about me.”
I don't. Instead, I worry about the rest of us, with no __[Isaac Asimov](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isaac_Asimov)__  around to inspire the young to learning and to science.
Carl Sagan
__[Carl Sagan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_Sagan)__  was a science popularizer, co-creator and host of __[Cosmos](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosmos:_A_Personal_Voyage)__ , and author or co-author of many books including __[The Demon-Haunted World](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Demon-Haunted_World)__ : Science as a Candle in the Dark.

A4 Video Converter not only boasts an aesthetically pleasing design, but its logical and organized structure makes it a no-brainer to use.
Besides converting video among popular video formats, the program extracts audio into a wide range of codecs and can capture movie frames as individual image files. When converting files, you can specify such variables as frame rate, compression, audio format, and bit rate.
Like every other tool in A4 Video Converter, the cutting feature is easy to use, letting you select starting and ending points via a slider and providing a preview window for reference.
The trial version does place a watermark on your output files, but that's much less restrictive than many competing apps.
This utility makes a quality pick for home users, especially those who need powers that go beyond simple conversions.

__[PNR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Passenger_name_record)__  data transfer: __[EU Parliament](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Parliament)__  gets angry
10 September, 2003
» EU Policy | Privacy | Airline Passenger Data
On 12 September the moratorium expires on the transfer of __[European](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Europe)__ 
passenger-data to the __[United States](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States)__ . Already harsh words are being
exchanged between __[EU](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Parliament)__  institutions, one of the last realms of diplomatic
kindness. "The violation of __[EU](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Parliament)__  legislation is continuing and with it the
rights of __[European](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Europe)__  citizens are being violated." This judgement from an
official Working Document of the __[European Parliament](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Parliament)__  is aimed at the
__[Commission](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Commission)__ , which, according to the document, "in the 6 months since the
adoption of __[Parliament](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Parliament)__ 's resolution (on the transfer of Airline
Passenger's __[PNR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Passenger_name_record)__  data to __[US](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States)__  authorities) has made very little progress
with regard to ensuring that __[EU](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Parliament)__  data protection legislation is observed".
Still, the __[EP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Parliament)__  rapporteur, __[Dutch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netherlands)__  Liberal Johanna Boogerd-Quaak, continues,
"Your rapporteur believes that the __[US](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States)__  commitments do not offer adequate
protection." "This", she concludes, "is a flagrant violation of __[EU](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Parliament)__  data
protection legislation, as laid down in __[Directive](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Directive_(European_Union))__  95/46 __[EC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Commission)__  and Regulation
2299/89." Members of __[Parliament](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Parliament)__  are now ready to prepare two oral
questions for the Council and the Commission, and eventually take legal
action before the __[European Court of Justice](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Court_of_Justice)__ .
On 13 March, the __[Parliament](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Parliament)__  passed a resolution containing criticism of
the __[Commission](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Commission)__ 's secretive negotiations with __[US](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States)__  envoys about the
transfer of airline passenger's personal data to the __[United States](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States)__ .
Parliament was angry about the lack of adequate level of data protection.
It urged the __[Commission](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Commission)__  to ensure that __[EU](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Parliament)__  Privacy and __[Data Protection](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_privacy)__  law
would be respected. Up to the present day that is not the case. The
procedure that might now follow is laid down in Article 232 of the __[EC Treaty](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treaty_of_Rome)__ . First an official warning by the __[Parliament](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Parliament)__ . Next, action before
the __[Strasbourg](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strasbourg)__  court that could result in the __[Commission](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Commission)__  being obliged to
stop the transfer immediately. Already on 2 September, the Chair of the EP
Civil Liberties Committee has taken first steps to prepare such action.
This is also what the __[Parliament](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Parliament)__  will urge now: a prohibition of all data
transfer on a 'pull' basis by 1 October, and an international agreement
that will have to be in accordance with __[EU](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Parliament)__  data protection law. In her
Working Paper, Mrs. Boogerd-Quaak goes into some detail and exemplifies
minimum requirements any future arrangement should meet to avoid legal
action, such as reducing the storage time from 7 years to the duration of
the passenger's stay in the __[US](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States)__  and reconsidering whether __[PNR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Passenger_name_record)__  transfer is
adequate in the proclaimed fight against terrorism.
On 5 May __[EDRi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Digital_Rights)__  launched a campaign against the __[PNR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Passenger_name_record)__  transfer, with letters
passengers can send to the national Data Protection Authority in their
country to request an investigation of the illegal transfer of their
personal data.

Underground Utility Lines
August 4, 2008
By jeffcheney 1 Comment
Â
There has been a great deal of discussion the last few weeks about theabove ground utility lines along Eldorado.Â Â Shelly Slater, Channel 8 News, even covered the issue in her news report.Â  See the story HEREÂ Â
This item will be discussed this Tuesdy, August 5th, at our City Council meeting.Â  The staff report we were provided isÂ attached below:
Â Â Â Â
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Office of the City Manager
Re:Â Â Â Â Utility Undergrounding â€“ Background and Issue Paper
Â While the construction of utility poles in and along the __[Eldorado](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eldorado,_Texas)__  (between the __[Dallas North Tollway](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dallas_North_Tollway)__  and FM423) corridor have prompted a great deal of discussion and debate, it is important to note that this issue has been one with which cities have struggled for some time. As you will see below, __[Frisco](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frisco,_Texas)__ , as well as other cities, have been attempting to regulate this issue for some time. However, we all continue to be hampered by the decisions of the __[Public Utility Commission](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_utilities_commission)__  and the courts of the state of __[Texas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Texas)__ . This paper attempts to provide some historical perspective on this overall issue and also highlight for you some specifics on related cost projections.
NOTE: Please note that the only cost numbers contained in this report that are confirmed at this point is the cost of burying the Coserv lines along __[Eldorado](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eldorado,_Texas)__ . Other numbers are calculated based on the data at hand at the time of completing this report. However, such additional cost projections are fairly conservative based on prevailing market data.
Historical Perspective of the Undergrounding Issue:
The section attempts to provide you with a high level historical perspective of some of the events that have impacted decisions related to the undergrounding of utilities.
__[The City](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Francisco)__  of __[Frisco](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frisco,_Texas)__  has been attempting to regulate the undergrounding of utilities for a number of years. There have been provisions contained in the Subdivision Regulations for a number of years regarding this matter, some of which have had to be removed due to court cases related to this issue. __[The City](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Francisco)__  also passed an Underground Utility ordinance a couple of years ago to deal with utility lines along thoroughfares. However, if the city says the developer must bury the lines along thoroughfares and the cost of that burial has to be paid by the developer then the developer will argue they are carrying a disproportionate amount of the cost and/or that the city does not have a valid governmental interest in having the lines buried.Â  And if the city says the utility must bury the lines along thoroughfares and the cost of burial has to be paid by the utility then the utility will argue that the cost of burial would have to be passed along to the rate payer thus violating their rate tariff set by the __[PUC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_utilities_commission)__  (__[Oncor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Energy_Future_Holdings)__ ) or simply violates their __[Board](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Board_of_directors)__  adopted rate structure (Coserv). In summary, these recent court cases prevent the city from being able to require the burial of lines unless the city (the tax payer) pays the costs. A quick cost analysis of the impact the __[Eldorado](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eldorado,_Texas)__  issue, as well as the overall issue, could have is provided in the next section.
Â Cost Analysis:
This section provides a high level review of the estimated cost to address the undergrounding issue. It examines the cost from a neutral perspective of who may have to pay these costs but then also provides an analysis of how that cost, if transferred to the __[City](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Francisco)__  might impact the tax rate.
Cost Estimate Example â€“Â
Edlorado Parkway:
Approximately $5,500,000 to bury Coserv lines on both sides of Eldorado Parkway (estimate provided by Coserv Electric, see Attachment #1)
$5,500,000 Ã· 4.6 miles (approx. 2.3 mi. of right-of-way per side) = ~$1,195,562 per mile
(This calculation is the estimate to bury the Eldorado Coserv line only and does NOT include the cost of a private easement, boring or burial cost of any additional utilities such as cable. Also, this assumes the cost for the entire length of this section of roadway thus any reduction in length drives up the cost per mile estimate.)
Â Potential Additional Costs:
These estimates are based on general market knowledge and could be higher or lower. However, a very conservative approach was taken to completing these estimates.
Item/ServiceÂ Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â AssumptionsÂ Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Estimated Cost
Private EasementÂ Â Â Â  Â Â Â Â 15′ easement @ $10sfÂ Â Â Â Â Â Â Â $1,584,000
Sidewalk\Landscape\
Screening ReplacementÂ Â Â Â 1 mile of replacementÂ Â Â Â Â Â Â Â $700,000Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â
Cable and\or Telco Burial 15% of CoservÂ Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â $825,000
BoringÂ Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â $Unknown .
TotalÂ Â  $3,109,000
If these additional costs were realized the project cost would total approximately $8,609,000.
Funding â€“
City – If the City of Frisco were to assume the cost of burying the Edlorado Coserv line only ($5,500,000), there would need to be an adjustment to the tax rate to cover such cost. Below is an approximation of what that adjustment would need to look like:
Â¢.01 on Tax Rate generates = $1,264,672, therefore, it would take a Â¢.043 __[Tax Rate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tax_rate)__  increase to fund the Eldorado Coserv line only.
Below is provided an approximation of what a tax rate adjustment would look like if the City of Frisco were to assume all of the projected cost above $8,609,000:
Â¢.01 on Tax Rate generates = $1,264,672 therefore, it would take a Â¢.068 __[Tax Rate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tax_rate)__  increase to fund the Eldorado Coserv line only.
Underground Utility Fees â€“ Why not pay for this from the fees that have already been collected from the Underground Utility Fee Ordinance? First, we only have a total of $368,834.00 in the account meaning there is nowhere near enough to complete the project in question – __[Eldorado](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eldorado,_Texas)__ . Second, the majority of the funds we do have are in other “Utility Zones” defined in the Ordinance which means the majority of the funds are not eligible to be spent on the __[Eldorado](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eldorado,_Texas)__  project because they were collected in other “Zones.” __[Third](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Third_(chord))__ , and most importantly, these funds will more than likely have to be returned to those who paid them due to the enforcement issues with the ordinance outlined in the “Historical Perspective” section above.
Tariff Change â€“ __[Oncor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Energy_Future_Holdings)__  has the ability to enter into agreements with cities to pay for undergrounding facilities. These agreements, on a project by project basis, spread the cost of the project across all rate payers in the city. However, there are a number of issues with this process that make it a very risky proposition. Not the least of which is the fact that an agreement can be entered into by the city to bury an __[Oncor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Energy_Future_Holdings)__  line only to have Coserv come right down the same easement with an overhead line. This problem is identified in item #2 below and has already hit the City of Allen. Also, Coserv which is the provider along __[Eldorado](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eldorado,_Texas)__  has no such program available.
Problems that will continue after funding determination has been made (these apply to all such easements not just __[Eldorado](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eldorado,_Texas)__ ) â€“
This section outlines some of the problems that would continue even after a funding determination is made related to the Eldorado Parkway utility matter.
The above cost estimate from Coserv does NOT include burying other utilities currently on the overhead lines such as cable and\or telephone.
No matter the funding source, once a line is buried this action does not prevent another utility provider from coming right down the same easement and putting up overhead lines where the previous lines would just have been buried. This problem exists unless of course __[the City](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Francisco)__  (the tax payers) pays AGAIN to have the new lines buried. By way of example, if the Coserv lines along __[Eldorado](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eldorado,_Texas)__  are buried by the __[City](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Francisco)__ , then if Coserv wants to upgrade those lines in the future via overhead lines or if another utility provider wants to go in the same location with overhead lines they would have the right to do so unless the __[City](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Francisco)__  paid to bury them a second time.
If __[Eldorado](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eldorado,_Texas)__  lines are buried at tax payer expense then what is the next line to be buried, at what cost and do you continue to raises taxes to bury lines? If it cost $5.5 million to bury only (2.3 miles x 2 =) 4.6 miles of line and the city has roughly 77 miles of thoroughfares and if the cost is similar to the line on Eldorado Parkway as outlined above that would equate to approximately $92,058,274 for one side of each thoroughfare. For both sides that would be approximately $184,116,548. Again, none of these numbers account for the “additional costs”, as outlined above, that may come into play.
Neighboring City’s Experiences:
Allen -
Stated that __[Allen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allen,_Texas)__  “recently paid to have __[Oncor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Energy_Future_Holdings)__  put in underground lines along Stacy Road only to have CoServ put up overhead lines along the same section of roadway.” Stated that there really is “no solution to the problem due to the above [problem] and due to when the line needs to be expanded, the city is faced with the choice again of paying or having the line constructed overhead.”
They went on to say that if we find the “silver bullet” to be sure to let them know.
Plano â€“
“Our subdivision ordinance limits the placement of above ground utilities to major thoroughfares (same as Frisco).Â  SubdivisionsÂ are occasionallyÂ built along a major thoroughfare without power lines, only to have them installed later.”Â  “SometimesÂ homeowners complain, but eventually theyÂ come to understand that the utility company has the right.”
Little Elm â€“
“We are having identical issues.” Co-Serv has discussed a “secondary feed” needed down to the end of the LE peninsula and that the only way to get there is a parallel line along the south side of Eldorado Parkway (existing overhead is on the north side). “CoServ, and for that matter every other electric utility, takes the position that if you want it under ground, the city is expected to pay 100% of the cost.”
Coserv Questions and Response Concerning Eldorado and Undergrounding in General:
Questions â€“
(1) Would CoServ consider adding an additional charge to its customers in __[Frisco](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frisco,_Texas)__  to pay to place its lines along major thoroughfares underground?
(2) If the answer to 1 is yes, what do you need from the city of __[Frisco](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frisco,_Texas)__  to institute such a charge?
(3) If the answer to 1 is yes, what do you believe the monthly cost would be per customer?
Response â€“
“CoServ has been approached by other cities we serve and asked similar questions. Our response thus far has been “no”, because…
* The cost of underground construction is 3 to 5 times the cost of overhead construction and we have experienced recent dramatic increases in the cost of labor and materials. We’re seeing some underground construction costs in excess of $1 million per mile.
* There are tremendous logistical challenges with converting overhead to underground, not the least of which is cable and communications attachments, adequate underground easements, scheduling, etc. All of these can be managed, but not easily.
* At the point we agree with one municipal entity, we should expect to do it with all of them.
CoServ is willing to sit down with you and/or your designated city representatives and try to plan conversion of overhead to underground facilities. Because of road widening, or other road construction issues, we are frequently confronted with this question. We’d prefer to plan these changes without imposing fees/charges to our members. The issue of fees/charges, as you know, is ultimately a question CoServ’s elected board of directors must address. My understanding of their direction for me is to find ways to convert without raising rates.”
Summary:
The bottom line is that the cost of burying utility line is very high and the available solutions are fraught with problems of their own.Â  Additionally, the actions of the __[PUC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_utilities_commission)__  and our __[Texas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Texas)__  courts have further exacerbated the problems. On one hand, cities are being told they do not have the authority to regulate this infrastructure forcing it to be underground and on the other hand even if cities fund the undergrounding there is no guarantee that the buried facilities will remain underground thus wasting taxpayers’ dollars.

Finals pain before success
August 22nd 2006 05:29
After seven consecutive wins, the __[Fremantle Dockers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fremantle_Football_Club)__  are being talked up as legitimate premiership contenders.
Some commentators of the game are even going as far to suggest that a __[Dockers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fremantle_Football_Club)__  flag in 2006 isn't out of the realms of possibility, and while this a romantic notion it isn't necessarily in lines with reality.
History suggests that a side needs to experience finals pain before they can genuinely contend for the premiership.
The __[Dockers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fremantle_Football_Club)__  cross-town rivals __[West Coast](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_Coast_Eagles)__  fell short at the last hurdle in 1991 against __[Hawthorn](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hawthorn_Football_Club)__ , but bounced back the next season to claim the first of two premierships in three years for the club.
Even __[Brisbane](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brisbane)__ , regarded by many as the greatest side of the modern era played five finals from 1999 to 2000 before claiming the first of three flags in 2001.
Compare this with __[Fremantle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fremantle_Football_Club)__  who have played one final since their inception in 1995- a 44-point loss to __[Essendon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Essendon_Football_Club)__  at __[Subiaco](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subiaco_Oval)__  in 2003, and you can see why any talk of
a __[Docker](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fremantle_Football_Club)__  premiership is premature.
One only has to ask the likes of __[Port Adelaide](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Port_Adelaide_Football_Club)__ , __[Sydney](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sydney_Swans)__  or __[St Kilda](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St_Kilda_Football_Club)__  to find out how hard it is to win a premiership.
Consider this, the __[Power](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Port_Adelaide_Football_Club)__  played seven finals from 2001-03 and were arguably the best side in the competition during the season proper, having collected three straight minor premierships from 2002-04, but didn't snag their first flag until '04.
The __[Saints](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St._George_Illawarra_Dragons)__  would have to join __[Port](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Port_Adelaide_Football_Club)__  as the most unlucky side of the modern era.
The men from __[Moorabbin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moorabbin,_Victoria)__  haven't tasted premiership success since 1966, and have lost consecutive preliminary finals to the __[Power](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Port_Adelaide_Football_Club)__  and __[Sydney](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sydney_Swans)__  respectively.
One would suggest that the premiership window has closed on the __[Saints](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St._George_Illawarra_Dragons)__ .
Even last year's premiers have fallen short in recent years prior to their success of 2005.
The __[Swans](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sydney_Swans)__  lost a preliminary final to eventual premiers __[Brisbane](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brisbane)__  in 2003, after being right in the match at three-quarter time and seemingly having the __[Lions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lions_(Super_Rugby))__  on the rope.
__[Sydney](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sydney_Swans)__  experienced more pain in '04 when they were comprehensively beaten by the __[Saints](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St._George_Illawarra_Dragons)__  to the tune of 61 points in a semi-final.
Would you have predicted the __[Swans](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sydney_Swans)__  to come out the following season and capture the flag?
Probably not, but it's clear that they were better for the experience.
Experience is the key, something which Fremantle lacks, with only skipper Peter Bell,hard-man Josh Carr, Jarrad Schofield and former Lion Des Headland tasting premiership success
Adding further weight to the lack of experience argument is the fact that the three players in the __[Fremantle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fremantle_Football_Club)__  squad to have played the most finals have done so with other clubs, __[Jarrad Schofield](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jarrad_Schofield)__  (17) with __[Port Adelaide](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Port_Adelaide_Football_Club)__ , __[Peter Bell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Bell_(Australian_footballer_born_1976))__  (16) with the __[Kangaroos](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Melbourne_Football_Club)__  and __[Dockers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fremantle_Football_Club)__  and __[Jeff Farmer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeff_Farmer_(footballer))__  (7) with __[Melbourne](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Melbourne_Football_Club)__  and __[Freo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fremantle_Football_Club)__ .
Thus any talk of a __[Fremantle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fremantle_Football_Club)__  premiership is all too premature. Let them win a final first and see where it takes them.
Remember, finals pain before premiership gain.

The __[Black Church](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_church)__  and the __[Prosperity Gospel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prosperity_theology)__ 
Friday, October 1, 2010
The scandals surrounding __[Atlanta](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlanta)__ ’s Bishop __[Eddie Long](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eddie_Long)__  now center on allegations of sexual immorality put forth by four young men who had been teenagers under his ministry. But previous attention had been directed at the financial elements of his ministry at __[Atlanta](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlanta)__ ’s __[New Birth Missionary Baptist Church](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Birth_Missionary_Baptist_Church)__ .
__[Eddie Long](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eddie_Long)__  is a teacher of prosperity theology, a perverse distortion of the gospel that transforms the message of __[Christ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christ)__  into a message of secular salvation through wealth and prosperity. Scholars of the movement have studied why it is that poor, disadvantaged, and disenfranchised people seem so drawn to a false gospel that leaves them poor but makes their preachers wealthy. They seem to find encouragement and hope, even a source of pride, in a pastor who preaches prosperity and lives in ostentatious wealth, even as they contribute their own meager funds.
The __[Bible](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bible)__  is clear in warning against false prophets who preach false gospels and those who would use spiritual authority for their own wealth. The world is scandalized by the false promises of prosperity, and believers in __[Christ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christ)__  should be just as scandalized about this false promise. But __[Christians](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christian)__  should be far more concerned about the eternal consequences of prosperity theology — its false promise of salvation through financial abundance, of health and wealth through the exercise of “seed faith.” Missing from the prosperity gospel is the message of salvation through faith in __[Christ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christ)__  alone — a salvation that makes every believer unspeakably wealthy in the grace of __[Christ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christ)__  but does not promise earthly riches or unblemished physical health.
Writing in the “Houses of Worship” column in today’s edition of The Wall Street Journal, DeForest B. ["Buster"] Soaries, Jr., pastor of the First Baptist Church of Lincoln Gardens in Somerset, New Jersey, writes of the scandal of the prosperity gospel and its popularity among African American churches:
The prosperity gospel—the idea that __[God](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/God)__  guarantees truly faithful
believers physical health and financial wealth—is not new. But cable and
satellite television broadcasting have turned prosperity preachers into
celebrities that have followings similar to musicians and movie stars.
A movement and a theology that once seemed like an aberration among
black churches now appears to be mainstream.
He writes further:
Teaching that desire for more material possessions is a sign of one’s
religious piety is simply offering a justification for crass
consumerism. Prosperity theology elevates greed to a virtue instead of
leaving it as one of the seven deadly sins.
Of course, it is much easier for clergy to preach this gospel when they
are living proof that the “system” works. Hence the celebrity-like
lifestyles of so many religious leaders. The fact that the people most
likely to do well in the prosperity gospel movement are the people at
the top suggests that it is all an ecclesiastical pyramid scheme.
Soaries seems mostly concerned in this article about the false promises of wealth and the economic effects of these teachings on __[African Americans](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/African_American)__ . All __[Christians](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christian)__  should share his outrage and know that prosperity theology is found among all races and ethnicities. The television screens are filled with their messages and heresies.
But the central problem with prosperity theology is that is is a false gospel. The prosperity preachers do not promise too much. They promise all the wrong things.
Of course, The Wall Street Journal is an interesting place to find an article on prosperity theology. The editors of that famous newspaper know what leads to financial wealth — that is their business — and they know that prosperity theology leads into deeper poverty. It’s only those at the top who drive the expensive cars and ride in private jets.
DeForest B. Soaries, Jr., “__[Black Churches](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_church)__  and the __[Prosperity Gospel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prosperity_theology)__ ,” The Wall Street Journal, Friday, October 1, 2010.

President Obama and Same-Sex Marriage — The Dance Continues

Study of weather changes is constantBy Donal Hickey Monday, February 21, 2011__[Irish](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republic_of_Ireland)__  people’s obsession with the weather, and what ‘it’s going to do’, is not
unique.Many of the signs on which traditional weather prediction has always been based
are also talked about in other parts of the world.
Even though the land and climate in both countries are very different, the weather-conscious __[Irish](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republic_of_Ireland)__  farmer has, for example, much in common with, say, a fellow farmer in __[Greece](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greece)__ .
For thousands of years before Jean Byrne, or __[Martin King](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martin_Luther_King,_Jr.)__ , came on the television each night to give us scientific forecasts, people looked to the sky, plants, and animals for indications of what the morrow would bring.
Indeed, there’s a striking similarity in the signs on which amateur meteorologists of old, around the world, based their predictions. This is borne out by retired __[UCC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_College_Cork)__  classics lecturer, Dr Patrick Cronin, in a newly-published study spanning 3,000 years.
The scholarly tome sets out the attempts made by the __[Greeks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greece)__  to predict weather change by naked-eye observation of signs from the sky, unaided by scientific meteorology.
Knowledge of weather lore gained while growing up on a farm in __[Sliabh Luachra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sliabh_Luachra)__ , close to the __[Cork](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/County_Cork)__ /__[Kerry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/County_Kerry)__  border, was fundamental in Dr Cronin’s later study of how the __[Greeks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greece)__  went about it. Much of his seminal knowledge was gleaned from his father while they saved hay or worked in the bog together, or while observing the fire on the hearth with his mother.
This is acknowledged in the book’s dedication, which reads: ‘To the memory of my father, who taught me to read the wind.’ In a foreword, __[TCD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trinity_College,_Dublin)__  Emeritus Professor George Huxley describes Dr Cronin as a scholar by vocation and a countryman at heart.
He has combined his boyhood insights with his knowledge of the __[Greek](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greece)__  language. But his rural upbringing helped him in another way — while the greater part of his research was carried out at his desk and in academic libraries, he could easily identify with the old people he interviewed in the __[Greek](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greece)__  countryside.
It was from farmers, shepherds, and sailors that he learned a deal about __[Greek](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greece)__  weather lore. His book contains a catalogue of
720 signs derived from clouds, comets, dew, frost, mist, moon, winds and many other natural phenomena.
The crucial importance of the weather for agriculture is recognised in an ancient __[Greek](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greece)__  proverb with a universal application — it is the seasons, not the soil, that bear crops. Most of the predictions in __[Ireland](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republic_of_Ireland)__  and __[Greece](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greece)__  are based on observation of birds, animals, insects and fish, the sun and the moon.
The __[Greeks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greece)__ , however, use far more signs from animals and the sky than we do, though some signs are common to both countries. One is that gulls fly in from the sea before a storm, often referred to by people in __[Cork](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/County_Cork)__ , __[Kerry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/County_Kerry)__ , __[Donegal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donegal_GAA)__  and __[Tipperary](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tipperary_GAA)__ . Another is that streaks of light beneath the sun are a sign of bad weather — found in the folk traditions of the Blasket islands, and other areas along the __[west coast](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_Coast_of_the_United_States)__ . Dr Cronin grew up in a place with a lyrical name that would have been familiar to the great __[Gaelic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scottish_Gaelic)__  poets, Eoghan Ruadh Ó Suilleabhain and Aogan Ó Rathaille, who hailed from the area. It’s called Magha an tSamhraidh (summer pasture), not far from the Paps Mountains.
People in the area would look towards the __[Paps](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breast)__ , and other mountains, for weather indications from the presence of cloud, clarity of the atmosphere and other observations. Low clouds on the mountains are seen as a sure sign of approaching rain.
Other mountains mentioned by him include Clara and Muisire, in __[Co Cork](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/County_Cork)__ , and Cnoc Firinne, near __[Ballingarry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ballingarry,_County_Limerick)__ , in __[Co Limerick](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/County_Limerick)__ . __[Translated](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Translation)__ , Cnoc Firinne means hill of truth, believed to be so named because of the accurate weather indications it rendered farmers through the centuries.
The sudden appearance of thousands of ants on a road in __[Ireland](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republic_of_Ireland)__  has always been regarded as a portent of rain. The ancient __[Greeks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greece)__  also used this weather sign. And Dr Cronin believes that faith placed in ants as weather prophets is justified. Ants, he says, have a high sensitivity to atmospheric change and can anticipate rain sooner than man.
Another belief common to __[Ireland](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republic_of_Ireland)__ , __[Greece](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greece)__ , and many other countries is that if swallows fly low it is a sign of rain. This sign is reliable, he remarks. Swallows are able to catch insects at high levels in fine weather, but when the atmosphere is very humid, just prior to rain, insects remain near ground level so that swallows descend in pursuit.
Not all the old signs could be trusted, but people all over the world have benefited over millennia from the wisdom of weather lore.

Integrable Teichmuller spaces
We introduce a new kind of subspaces of the universal
Teichmuller space. Some characterizations of them are given in terms
of univalent functions, Beltrami coefficients and quasisymmetric
homeomorphisms of the boundary of the unit disc.

Teichmuller contraction and renormalization
According to Royden-Gardiner theorem, any holomorphic
mapping between Teichmuller spaces does not expand the Teichmuller
distance. (Just like Schwarz-Pick theorem says that any holomorphic
mapping between hyperbolic __[Riemann](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bernhard_Riemann)__  surfaces does not expand the
Poincare metric.) In the theory of renormalizations, one often wants
to show that the renormalization map (which is defined in a transcendental
way) on the space of certain dynamical systems is hyperbolic or
contracting.
Therefore Royden-Gardiner theorem is an obvious
candidate of tools to obtain the contraction. This idea was first
used by Sullivan in his work on generalized Feigenbaum type renormalization.
In this talk, we will discuss two applications of Teichmuller
theory to renormalizations:
1. Parabolic renormalization for parabolic fixed
points and their perturbations. 2. Rigidity of real quadratic
polynomials only using Yoccoz's combinatorial a priori bounds.
For these cases, we deal with the Teichmuller
spaces of a disk or a punctured disk and show that a certain inclusion
map induces a contraction in Teichmuller distance.

The complex a priori bounds, continued
We describe how to reduce the a priori bounds for
bounded-primitive type renormalization to a simple combinatorial
statement regarding the combinatorial dynamics of arcs. We show
how the combinatorial statement follows from the expanding dynamics
on the __[Hubbard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_H._Hubbard)__  tree.

A fundamental domain for V_{3}.
__[Abstract](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abstract_(summary))__ : We consider the space V_{n} of quadratic
rational maps with one named critical point of period n, quotiented
by __[M](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metre)__ \"obius conjugacy preserving named critical points. Thus,
the space V_{1} is the space of all quadratic polynomials up to
affine conjugacy. The parameter space V_{1} must be one of the most
studied in all dynamics. But V_{1} differs from most other parameter
spaces in an important respect: there is a natural ``base map''
and, within the Mandelbrot set, natural paths, up to a natural homotopy,
to any other map in the Mandelbrot set. The simplest parameter space
for which this fails to be true is V_{3}.
One can say (truthfully) that there is no canonical
choice of fundamental domain for V_{3,m}, which is obtained from
V_{3} by removing a natural dynamically defined puncture set.
I shall exhibit a fundamental domain, using the dynamical planes
of three maps within V_{3} and a theory known as the ``Resident's
View''. This enables one to at least formulate an analogue of
__[MLC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multi-level_cell)__  for this family.
Three parts of the fundamental domain are straightforward
(although the proof in one of these cases is probably new). The
structure of the fourth part is much more interesting, involving
a spiral in the dynamical plane of the so-called ``aeroplane''
quadratic polynomial z\mapsto z^{2}+c for the (unique) real parameter
c for which the critical point 0 has period 3.

Measures on hyperbolic surface laminations
We will consider laminations by hyperbolic Riemann
surfaces, and different
measures that can be associated with these objects (holonomy-invariant
measures, harmonic measures, measures invariant under the geodesic
and
horocycle flows). We will state some results that show how these
measures
are related. We will mainly focus on two families of examples: Riccati
foliations and Hilbert modular foliations.

Newton's Method in two complex variables: Indeterminant points
and the topology of basins of attraction
The equations x(x-1)=0, y^2+Bxy-y=0 are easy
to solve, but the Newton Map
N: C^2 \rightarrow C^2 for finding the four roots has very complicated
dynamics: N is four-to-one and N has points of indeterminacy.
Furthermore, high iterates of N have many points of indeterminacy.
By restricting to parameters |1-B|>1, all of these points of
indeterminacy are in the set X_l = Re(x) < 1/2, which is invariant
under N. If one wants to consider the homotopy type of a basin
of attraction, __[W](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Watt)__ (r_i), for one of the roots r_i \in X_l under
N, one encounters a kind of ``topological indeterminacy.'' When
studying the homotopy type of a loop \gamma in __[W](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Watt)__ (r_i), should
one consider the homotopies that hit the points of indeterminacy
of N^k or should one avoid them? Both seem reasonable. To avoid
such questions, one can perform blow-ups at the points of indeterminacy
of all iterates of N, obtaining a new space X_l^\infty from X_l
on which all iterates of N are defined.
We show how to make precise the notion of linking
numbers in X_l^\infty, overcoming a different kind of indeterminacy
that is a result of the fact that H_2(X_l^\infty) is infinitely
generated. Having developed this technology, I will explain how
we can use it to study the homotopy type of the basins of attraction
__[W](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Watt)__ (r_i) within X_l^\infty.

Dynamics of foliated spaces in codimension greater than one
__[Abstract](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abstract_(summary))__ . Dynamics of foliated spaces can be characterized
by the exceptional minimal sets and topological entropy. Dynamical
theory of codimension one foliations was developed by Hector, Cantwell
and Conlon, and others. We present some results on exceptional minimal
sets, which are analogous to the attractors in a standard dynamical
system, of foliated spaces in codimension greater than one.

Holomorphic endomorphisms of configuration spaces
Abstract: The most traditional configuration space
C(X,n) of a complex space X consists of all n point subsets ("configurations")
__[Q](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Q_factor)__  in X.
If X carries an additional geometric structure, it may be taken
into account; say if X=CP^m or C^m, the space C(X,n;gp) of geometrically
generic configurations consists of all n point configurations __[Q](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Q_factor)__ 
such that no hyperplane in X contains more than m points of Q. An
automorphism T of X (preserving an additional geometric structure,
whenever it is relevant) produces a holomorphic endomorphism f of
the configuration space via f(__[Q](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Q_factor)__ )=TQ. If the automorphism group Aut
X is a complex Lie group, one may take T=__[T](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Q_factor)__ (__[Q](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Q_factor)__ ) depending analytically
on a configuration Q and define the corresponding holomorphic endomorphism
f by f(__[Q](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Q_factor)__ )=T(__[Q](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Q_factor)__ )Q. Such a map f is called tame. In the talk, we shall
see that for every non-hyperbolic Riemann surface X all "non-degenerate"
holomorphic endomorphisms of configuration spaces C(X,n) are tame.
To some extent, this is true also for spaces of geometrically generic
configurations.

Tessellation and Lyubich-Minsky laminations associated with quadratic
maps
__[Abstract](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abstract_(summary))__ : In 1990s, M.Lyubich and Y.Minsky introduced
the hyperbolic 3-laminations associated with rational maps as an
analogue of the hyperbolic 3-manifolds associated with Kleinian
groups. In this talk I will present a new method to describe topological
and combinatorial changes of laminations associated with hyperbolic-to-parabolic
degeneration of quadratic maps.
The method is based on tessellation of filled Julia sets, which
gives a nice organization of the dynamics inside the filled Julia
set like
external rays outside.

in both cases, and a view towards generalization.

A lemma about families of epsilon pseudo-trajectories revisited
In hyperbolic dynamics there are results related
to the existence of a true trajectory near an epsilon pseudo-trajectory
for sufficiently small epsilon (although, formally, some of these
results are expressed rather differently.) Many years ago I found
a lemma which covers most of these questions. The proof is rather
involved and some famous mathematicians expressed complaints about
the difficulty. In this talk, I will present a simplified version
of the proof.

Anisotropic spaces of distributions and dynamical zeta functions
Abstract: (Joint work with M. Tsujii) The Ruelle
transfer operator is a powerful tool in ergodic theory, which involves
composition with the dynamics. Many relevant dynamical systems are
hyperbolic, i.e. they involve contracting and expanding directions.
Composition with a contraction
improves regularity - but composing with an expanding map "worsens"
regularity: It has been an open problem for many years to find a
space
of distributions on which composition by a hyperbolic __[diffeomorphism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diffeomorphism)__ 
(of finite smoothness) can be well understood. Last year we constructed
such a space and estimated the essential spectral radius of the
transfer operator on this space. After recalling this result, we
shall describe more recent progress including spectral interpretation
of zeroes of dynamical determinants.

The dynamics of the quasi-periodic Schroedinger cocycle at the

__[Abstract](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abstract_(summary))__ : We will study properties of the quasi-periodic
Schroedinger equation at the lowest energy of the spectrum. This
will lead us into the study of phase transitions. Moreover, we will
answer a question by M. Herman concerning the geometry of a certain
minimal set - a non-chaotic strange atractor - of the projective
Schroedinger cocycle. We study the case of large coupling constant
and __[Diophantine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diophantine_equation)__  frequency.

Topological properties of polynomial and analytic foliations
__[Abstract](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abstract_(summary))__ : Geometrical study of holomorphic foliations
of the complex plane, both projective and affine, lies on the boundary
of differential equations, topology and complex analysis. Foliations
of \Bbb CP^2 have an algebraic origin: they are defined by polynomial
vector fields, but their behavior is highly transcendental. Their
properties are drastically different from those of real polynomial
vector fields. Properties of density of leaves, absolute rigidity
and existence of a countable number of limit cycles were discovered
by different authors in 60s and 70s. The talk will present these
results together with a survey of the further development and open
problems.
Foliations of \Bbb C^2 have an analytic origin: they are defined
by analytic vector fields. Generic properties of these fields were
studied very recently. Yet genericity of density of leaves and existence
of the infinite number of complex limit cycles is recently proved.
Moreover, generic leaves of such foliations are either disks, or
cylinders. These results are obtained by graduate students Firsova,
Kutuzova and Volk.

Minimizers for random Lagrangian systems

and prove that for time-dependent random Lagrangian systems on compact
manifolds there exists a unique global minimizer. In the one-dimensional
case we show that the global minimizer corresponds to a hyperbolic
invariant measure for the random __[Lagrangian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lagrangian)__  flow. We also discuss
dynamical properties of shocks and show that their global structure
is quite rigid and reflects the topology of the configuration manifold.

Spectral Renormalization Group and Theory of Radiation
__[Abstract](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abstract_(summary))__ : Non-relativistic quantum electrodynamics
describes interaction of charged particles (electrons and nuclei)
with quantized electro-magnetic field (photons). The key problem
here is to describe emission and absorption of radiation by systems
of matter such as atoms and molecules. In this talk I will present
some recent rigorous results on the problem of radiation and describe
a novel renormalization group technique used in proving these results.
I will not assume any prior knowledge of quantum field theory or
quantum mechanics.

Henon renormalization (I)
__[Abstract](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abstract_(summary))__ : This mini-course will introduce a renormalization
operator for dissipative Henon-like maps. The fixed point of the
one-dimensional renormalization operator will also be a hyperbolic
fixed point of the Henon-renormalization operator. This corresponds
to universal geometrical properties of the __[Cantor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georg_Cantor)__  attractor of infinitely
renormalizable Henon-like maps. However, the two-dimensional theory
is richer than the unimodal case. In particular, the __[Cantor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georg_Cantor)__  attractor
is not rigid, does not lie on a smooth curve and generically does
not have bounded geometry. The quantitative aspects of these phenomena
are controlled by the average __[Jacobian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jacobian_matrix_and_determinant)__ .
The global topological properties of finitely renormalizable Henon-like
maps in phase and parameter space are also controlled by the average
__[Jacobian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jacobian_matrix_and_determinant)__ . In particular, density of hyperbolicity will be discussed
in a neighborhood of the infinitely renormalizable maps.

Renormalization of vector fields (I)
__[Abstract](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abstract_(summary))__ : This mini-course covers some of the recent
developments in the renormalization of flows - mainly __[Hamiltonian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamiltonian_mechanics)__ 
flows and skew flows. After stating some of the problems and describing
alternative approaches, we focus on the definition and basic properties
of a single renormalization step. A second part deals with the construction
of conjugacies and invariant tori, including shearless tori, and
non-differentiable tori for critical Hamiltonians. Then we discuss
properties related to the spectrum of the linearized renormalization
transformation, such as the accumulation rates for sequences of
closed orbits. The last part describes extensions from "simple"
to __[Diophantine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diophantine_equation)__  rotation vectors. This involves sequences of renormalization
transformations that are related to continued fractions expansions
in one and more dimensions. Whenever appropriate, the discussion
of details will be restricted to special cases where inessential
technical complications can be avoided.

Lower bounds for the entropy in several families of dynamical
systems
Abstract: Using soft techniques we prove lower bounds
for the maximum entropy of a system in a family in terms of the
entropy of a random product of the systems in the family. We accomplish
this for two families of immersions of the circle. For one family
this is joint work with Leonel Robert and Enrique Pujals and the
other Rafael de la Llave and Carles Simo. Time permitting we recall
a two dimensional analog whose entropy properties are still unknown,
but for which partial
results have been achieved in joint work with Francois Ledrappier,
Carles Simo and __[Amie Wilkinson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amie_Wilkinson)__ .

Super-stable manifolds for Newton's methods in two complex
variables
__[Abstract](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abstract_(summary))__ : While the equations x(x-1)=0, y^2+Bxy-y=0
are easy to solve, the dynamics of the Newton map N(x,y) for finding
the four roots is quite complicated. In particular, N is many-to-one
and N has points of indeterminacy.
The two vertical lines x=0 and x=1 are invariant under N and super-attracting.
Within these lines the ''circles'' Re(y) = 1/2 and Re(y) = (1-B)/2,
respectively, are hyperbolically repelling with multiplier 2.
In this talk we will prove that these circles have superstable
manifolds of real dimension 3 using the technique of holomorphic
motions. These manifolds extend to all points with Re(x) <
1/2 and Re(x) > 1/2 respectively and provide insight into the
topology of the basins of attraction for the four roots.
This work follows the ideas of __[John H. Hubbard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_H._Hubbard)__  and Sebastien Krief.

Renormalization for irrationally indifferent fixed points of
holomorphic maps
__[Abstract](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abstract_(summary))__ : Indifferent fixed points of holomorphic
maps give rise to delicate problems such as linearization problems,
discontinuous __[Julia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Julia_set)__  sets etc. In this talk, we review the study
of those phenomena from the renormalization point of view. We
define a certain class of holomorphic maps with "non-degenerate"
parabolic fixed points. The parabolic renormalizaion is defined
for this class and shown to leave the class invariant. Then the
class is still invariant under a small perturbation, therefore
we can handle irrationally indifferent fixed points with large
continued fraction coefficients. This is a joint work with Hiroyuki
Inou.
We will compare this approach with Yoccoz's and McMullen's renormalizations.
We will also mention possible applications such as Buff-Cheritat's
work toward positive measure __[Julia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Julia_set)__

Economic reform: It's the real economy, stupid
The exporting sector is not the only part of the economy that needs to become smart if Ireland is to recover, says Ronnie O’Toole
It was the __[Nobel prize](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nobel_Prize)__  winning __[Paul Krugman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Krugman)__  who said that “ productivity isn’ t everything, though in the long run it’ s nearly everything. A country’ s ability to improve its standard of living over time depends almost entirely on its ability to raise its output per worker.”
He said that in 1994, though writing in 2010 he might have put these points differently. In the short- run, productivity does little to solve what is a balance-sheet recession, though in the long run it’ s nearly everything. A country’ s ability to pay back its debts while minimizing the fall in its standard of living depends almost entirely on its ability to raise its output per worker.
Productivity is once again moving centre stage. If the sovereign debt crisis had one clear positive it was the focus it started to place on growth prospects going forward. Of course in the short run, the sheer scale of retrenchment which __[Ireland](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republic_of_Ireland)__  is being forced into will result in a weaker growth than would have otherwise been the case. However as we move beyond this, productivity growth will again take over as the primary driver of welfare.
This is where the Smart Economy debate, long derided as a wordy __[PR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_relations)__  distraction, will increase in relevance. What’ s disappointing about this debate is that up to now it has focused almost entirely on exporting firms, the one section of the economy that is already demonstrably smart.
The evidence of this is striking. In a research paper published in October, the __[ECB](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Central_Bank)__  ranked __[Ireland](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republic_of_Ireland)__  as being the most high-tech exporting country, far outpacing __[Austria](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Austria)__  and __[Finland](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finland)__  in second and third place respectively. The other countries with which we supposedly share so many similarities, namely __[Greece](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greece)__  and __[Spain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spain)__ , were at the opposite end of the scale. In the space of twenty years __[Ireland](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republic_of_Ireland)__  has moved to the quality end of the export spectrum, and is a world leader in pharmaceuticals, information technology and services.
However the debate on how we can make our exporting sector smarter has continued in what is an increasingly redundant debate. Many of these issues have been resolved a long time ago. Should we or shouldn’ t have an active industrial policy? Answer: We should and we do. Should we turn our back on services, and concentrate on manufacturing? Answer: No we shouldn’t, nor will we.
Why then do policymakers still focus on exporters? The reason is simple. Productivity growth destroys as it creates. Improving productivity requires out-dated practices to be swept away, companies to transform and workers to re-skill. It’s difficult, often unpopular, yet crucial for long-run economic health.
However when we create an exporting operation in __[Ireland](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republic_of_Ireland)__ , the pain is felt elsewhere. Maybe a plant gets shut in __[Israel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel)__ , or a planned expansion in the __[US](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States)__  is cancelled. Do you think that when the __[Polish](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poland)__  Government was pitching to __[Dell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dell)__  that it was worried about the job losses in __[Limerick](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Limerick)__ ? Of course not. Promoting export firms is a one-way bet, and avoids having to make the really difficult decisions.
What our exporters really need now is action to reduce the cost of operating a business from __[Ireland](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republic_of_Ireland)__ .
The source of this cost is the sectors which sell into the domestic market, many of whom are anything but smart. This is not just another jab at the public sector. Many sectors dominated by private provision in __[Ireland](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republic_of_Ireland)__  remain unreformed, inefficient and expensive.
Reforming these sectors will be difficult, and the benefits aren’ t immediate. Reform must be done sector by sector, ensuring that regulation promotes competition. The Government itself must become a very demanding customer for local services through its procurement practices.
The banking sector is a case in point. Banks are the gatekeepers for __[Ireland](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republic_of_Ireland)__ ’ s payments industry, the means by which we as a society pay for goods and services. Almost uniquely in __[Europe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Europe)__ , the __[Irish](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republic_of_Ireland)__  payments industry remains dominated by paper – i.e. cash and cheques - at a cost of €1bn annually to the economy.
The cost of our high use of cash and cheques goes beyond pure financial concerns. Wide-scale cash usage helps perpetuate the shadow economy, at a considerable cost to ordinary, compliant taxpayers. Further, the security challenges of transporting large volumes of cash are needlessly putting the lives of bank, retail and security staff at risk. Finally, there is a strong correlation between a country’ s use of cheques and the problem of a late payments culture, which in __[Ireland](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republic_of_Ireland)__  causes huge difficulties for __[SMEs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Small_and_medium_enterprises)__ .
Of course the payments issue is just one example of many. The recent Forfás report, “Making it Happen, Growing Enterprise for __[Ireland](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republic_of_Ireland)__ ”, sets out the range of actions needed to stimulate domestic productivity. It highlights the role of competition policy, particularly in the areas of legal and medical services, where costs remain very high despite the price falls in the rest of the economy. They also highlight public procurement as an area which needs to be overhauled. Firms react to the demands of consumers, and where the __[Government](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Government)__  is the consumer it has to become far more demanding.
We are not alone in this need to tackle structural reforms. The above __[ECB](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Central_Bank)__  report concluded that __[European](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Europe)__  policymakers have been using the strength of the __[Euro](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euro)__  as an excuse for __[Europe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Europe)__

__[Acer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acer_Inc.)__  Says It Has No Plans to Phase out Netbooks. __[Acer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acer_Inc.)__  on Wednesday in a statement

The company also said that it does not foresee tablets based on __[Sandy Bridge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sandy_Bridge)__  processors,
contrary to comments made earlier this week by an __[Acer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acer_Inc.)__  sales manager in __[Taiwan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taiwan)__ .
Lu Bing-hsian earlier this week told the __[IDG News Service](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IDG)__  that __[Acer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acer_Inc.)__  would begin
selling new tablet PCs in the first half of this year as it gradually phases out
netbooks and that tablets would come with processors based on __[Intel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intel)__ 's __[Sandy Bridge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sandy_Bridge)__ 
microarchitecture. "For the moment it is not foreseen yet ... devices based
on __[Sandy Bridge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sandy_Bridge)__ ," __[Acer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acer_Inc.)__  said. __[Acer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acer_Inc.)__  said the range of devices available to
users is expanding and that tablets "will find their space next to netbooks
and notebooks, without taking over." __[Acer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acer_Inc.)__  in November announced new tablets
with 5-inch, 7-inch and 10-inch screens running on __[Google](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google)__ 's __[Android operating system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Android_(operating_system))__ , which were also shown at the recent __[Consumer Electronics Show](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_CES)__ .

Grave_Addiction06-24-2005, 12:33 PMHopefully not a repost.
http://www.optimalcamouflage.com/reggie_retail.wma
evilmax1706-24-2005, 12:34 PMBullet point summary anyone?
Grave_Addiction06-24-2005, 12:53 PMIt can be kind of hard to hear Reggie at times, so I typed up the entire clip as best I could.
As you can see, __[Revolution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wii)__  will more than hold its own in graphical performance.
What we also know is that what you publishers and developers see when you look at the spec sheet of our competitor's new systems. Larger budgets, higher staffing, steeper learning curve and longer production schedules.
__[Nintendo Revolution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wii)__  is designed to be none of these. Our conscious decision was to take a different path. Revolution will be the home to stunning new game masterpieces from Nintendo and our third parties.
In fact, the balance built into __[Revolution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wii)__  makes it the perfect choice to achieve your highest creative goals. But if your budgets are a little more (motto?), I would recommend to also envision the creation of much better game experiences with much less hassle.
We expect the time frame needed to make Nintendo's __[Revolution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wii)__  game to be substantially shorter than all of our competitors. In effect, we see __[Revolution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wii)__  to be the best new console for game developing partners no matter what type of game you're making.
Finally for all of our retail partners, I can hear you whispering under your breaths, "Don't tell me about developing games, just tell me what games you're gonna deliver."
Well, let's talk about that. First, we expect the great third-party support we now have on __[Gamecube](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GameCube)__  to be both stronger and earlier on the __[Revolution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wii)__ . And we will be more aggressive than ever in having our own new in-house stars, the greatest gathering of (byte-sized characters?) in history by as early as possible.
You can expect new Nintendo intelluctual properties in the launch window. Our franchise stars are about to make some new friends.
And you should know that development of new Revolution titles is already underway.
Javery06-24-2005, 12:55 PMNice!
evilmax1706-24-2005, 12:58 PMMuch much appreciated for that, thank you.
"our already great third party support" was funny.
Sounds like they saw a video at first.
Shorter dev times + easy dev = hopefully tons of games
Strell06-24-2005, 12:59 PMnew game *couldn't understand what he was saying here* from Nintendo and our third parties.
He said "masterpieces."
That's all I have to add.
Now, where did this come from?
This speech?
I mean it sounds like we've only got about the last half of this speech.
It's apparent that at some point he must have been discussing raw graphical power.
"It will more than hold its own."
That makes feel a bit better about that issue, but it is Reggie, meaning I know it's his job to hype...He mentions competitor spec sheets as if he has something comparable to them right now (i.e., as he's talking to these people).
There's got to be some information on this somewhere.
I need some serious reassurance about the graphics, and it sounds like this could be the first indication that the power issue is about to be put to rest.
I mean, if all the systems are within 10% or so of each other in terms of raw power, then the graphics debate is dead.
Put the best graphical games of all three systems now, and you can barely tell a true difference.
I assume it's going to be exactly the same for the next generation.
Of course, that's just all my speculation.
jkam06-24-2005, 01:02 PMSounds good. I want to see __[Kid Icarus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kid_Icarus)__  back! I think Nintendo has a good idea with giving developers an easier task. It would be nice to see the __[Revolution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wii)__  get really solid 3rd party support. I wouldn't mind seeing some of the things that the __[XBOX](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xbox_(console))__  and the __[PS2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PlayStation_2)__  got such as Street Fighter Anniversary Collection (online) as long as there done right. The __[N64](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nintendo_64)__  and the __[Cube](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GameCube)__  had great games but lacked in pure numbers of titles. With this new approach they may be able to swing some back their way. Anxiously awaiting this console.
ryanbph06-24-2005, 01:03 PMI thought their was a recent interview with nintendo, saying they weren't done with the revolution.
How are they making the games, if they don't have an idea on what the revolution will be.
I am sure it will be easy to develop for Nintendo, but doesn't the __[XNA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_XNA)__ , also cut down on costs and development time?
evilmax1706-24-2005, 01:06 PMI need some serious reassurance about the graphics.
It's been said that the __[Rev](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Reverend)__  will be 3 times more powerful than the __[GCN](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GameCube)__ .
Look at __[RE4](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resident_Evil_4)__ , and picture it times 3.
I think that would look pretty good!
the3rdkey06-24-2005, 01:07 PMI thought their was a recent interview with nintendo, saying they weren't done with the revolution.
How are they making the games, if they don't have an idea on what the revolution will be.
I am sure it will be easy to develop for Nintendo, but doesn't the __[XNA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_XNA)__ , also cut down on costs and development time?
They are done with the __[SPECs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Specification_(technical_standard))__ ,
the final system design will be smaller.
Strell06-24-2005, 01:09 PMYea, and I know the bullshit "OMG 1600 TIMES MORE POWERFUL" from __[MS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft)__  and __[Sony](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sony)__  is just hype, and that the 2-3x power is something conservative from Nintendo, but I still want something a little more concrete than vague jargon.
Still, even a leap of that beyond Zelda/RE4/Metroid Prime is enough to render my brain dizzy.
Javery06-24-2005, 01:11 PMWell, we know games won't look as nice on the __[Revolution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wii)__  simply due to the lack of __[HD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High-definition_television)__  support unless you are one of those billion unlucky bastards without an HDTV...
Strell06-24-2005, 01:14 PMLet's see.
15 FPS game on HD.
Or 60 FPS game on normal tv.
Yea, I'm worried too.
willardhaven06-24-2005, 01:22 PMa 20" signal with s-video or component cables makes a lot of HD sets look like crap...
screw resolution, I like high FPS myself.
Revolution sounds like it will be good, I wish we could just get __[Gamecube](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GameCube)__  2 though.
jkam06-24-2005, 01:25 PMWell, we know games won't look as nice on the __[Revolution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wii)__  simply due to the lack of __[HD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High-definition_television)__  support unless you are one of those billion unlucky bastards without an HDTV...
I know your'e really ticked about the Revo and __[HD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High-definition_television)__ . There are already some sites up to try to sway Nintendo.
http://www.1080up.org/
You may want to e-mail Nintendo yourself as well. The more people that do may sway them to add it.
D4rkewolfe07-07-2005, 01:38 AMFirst -- please be civil and post here. Too many HD topics floating around.
Second -- HD is up in the air. Whether an article says it will be on there, or one says it won't, with over a year before release, anything can change.
Third -- Would the addition or subtraction of __[HD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High-definition_television)__  have an effect on you buying a __[Revolution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wii)__ ? Is it that important to you?
Finally -- Have a conversation, not a fight
That's from one of the NOA people in their forums.
So with the list going around, if you really want it, have it signed.
As they said, anything can change.
PawnTakesKing07-07-2005, 02:15 AM...unless you are one of those billion unlucky bastards without an HDTV...
*raises hand in shame*
MorPhiend07-16-2005, 07:35 PMHe said "masterpieces." That's all I have to add.

Of course, that's just all my speculation.
As to the graphical power, all I can say is search for the thread back around e3 time about the new patent concerning cube mapping. Some said that was old technology. But read the whole patent. It is not the same as the old "cube maps." It is a new technology that is designed to allow for "low" spec systems that consume low power to outperform high tech, expensive, loud energy wasting chipsets. I wouldn't be surprised if the specs themselves are on par with M$, and in practice are up to __[Sony](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sony)__ 's system - if this tech actually is part of the __[RevOlution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Revolution)__ ...
EDIT: I justlistened to this. Isn't it the pre-e3 Nintendo conference? Thatthing was an hour long. That's probably why you didn't notice.

Jewogle is not quite like any other Jewish site on the web. It looks like Google. (The look is, in fact, a parody). But, Jewogle is NOT a search engine of other Jewish sites. Jewogle brings you both a Kosher Search engine that allows you to find information across cyberspace from Jewogle certified kosher sites as well as giving an extensive listing of some of the most famous Jews in their respective fields.

This ‘Psychic’ Metal is Predicting a __[Christmas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christmas)__  Rally
By Dominic Frisby11/09/2011
Print
They call it 'Dr Copper' - the metal with a PhD in economics - because of its forecasting ability.It turned up in 2003 as the world recovered from the dotcom crash. It peaked in 2008, shortly before the stock market crash, and it rebounded in 2009.Sounds great. But in fact, if you look at it, copper actually rises and falls with general market sentiment. It's more of a barometer than forecaster.A far better forecaster would be a metal that moves before the event, a metal that peaks or troughs early – in late 2006, early 2007, say, or in 2010.Such a metal exists. It's copper's less widely discussed, less glamorous industrial cousin: zinc.So what can it tell us about today's market? And what's the best way to play it?Zinc isn't glamorous or world-savingUnlike uranium, rare earth metals, or even gold and silver, zinc is not a metal that is going to save the world. It's not the answer to looming energy, technical or monetary problems.Its main use (over 50%) is in galvanising, to prevent rust. Zinc is very reactive, so a quick coat of zinc on your iron or steel will attract all the oxidisation and protect the metal beneath. It's also used extensively in alloys (brass and bronze in particular) and compounds. You'll find zinc in a huge range of applications, from communication equipment to coins to cars to piping to bearings to water valves.It's widely used (only iron ore, copper and aluminium are more heavily used). But there's no huge deficit between global zinc supply and demand to get excited about – there's lots of it and when demand grows, production can be increased too.Identified worldwide resources are estimated at just below the two billion tonne mark. The largest deposits are in __[Canada](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canada)__ , the __[US](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States)__ , __[Australia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australia)__  and __[Iran](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iran)__ . Annual global production stands at around 12 million tonnes, 70% of which comes from mining and 30% from recycling.According to recent data made available to the International Lead and Zinc Study Group (ILZSG), world demand exceeded supply by 223,000 tonnes in 2011, in the year to date. World stock levels increased by 201,000 tonnes, although __[London Metal Exchange](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London_Metal_Exchange)__  stockpiles (along with those of all base metals, interestingly) have been declining since the summer.From the same data, we see world zinc production rose by 14.5%; apparent __[Chinese](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China)__  demand increased by 14.9% and world usage by 16.7%.A history of the zinc priceAs for the zinc price, it is trading in a fairly tight range. Its year high was just above $1.1/lb in February and its low, in October, was $0.80/lb.Here we see a long-term chart of zinc since 1989. It fell from about $0.90/lb in the late '80s to $0.40/lb in 1993, then spent the rest of the decade mired in a tight range between $0.40 and $0.55 or so, with one brief spike above that level.After the dotcom crash, it sunk even below $0.40/lb until 2003 when it began to creep up – in line with general market sentiment.But then in 2004-5 it broke out above that multi-year $0.50/lb or so cap and within two years quadrupled. In late 2006 it broke above $2/lb. Insane stuff. If ever there is a chart that reflects the bubble of credit and speculative excess the world got itself into in that period, it's this one.Then the zinc price began falling – ahead of the markets – and quickly returned to $0.50/lb break-out point, giving back all of the gains of the previous two or three years.We then got the proverbial 'dead cat bounce', which petered out at $1.20 in 2010. We have been stuck in a range ever since, between there and $0.80 on the downside. This month it has turned back up.Professor Zinc's psychic powersI would say Professor __[Zinc](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zinc)__  better reflects the real global state of things than the Dr __[Copper](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copper)__ . In July 2008 copper was making new highs (with oil), when zinc had long-since turned down, and the credit crunch was in full flight.In early 2011, copper made new highs again, above 2006 and 2007 levels – when the real economy was in a more parlous state. Here's a chart of copper over that period. To me, it is less a reflection of the economy and more a reflection of the speculative excess at the extreme end of finance.So what is zinc telling us now?It has turned up, and I see some buying coming back into the junior mining end of markets, so perhaps we can expect this rally to continue until __[Christmas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christmas)__  and even into the __[New Year](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Year)__ .But there are plenty of problems lurking on the sidelines, as we all know, so I would be ready to jump ship should they rear their ugly heads again. And I'll be watching closely to see if the zinc price provides an early warning of the next downturn.If you wanted to trade zinc, __[ETF Securities](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ETF_Securities)__  offers a zinc __[ETF](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exchange-traded_fund)__  (__[LSE](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London_Stock_Exchange)__ : __[ZINC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zinc)__ ). But I can't see the point. I don't see huge price rises in zinc itself coming. The top large-cap zinc-producing companies include __[Xstrata](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xstrata)__ , __[OZ Minerals](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OZ_Minerals)__ , __[Teck Cominco](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teck_Resources)__  and __[Glencore](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glencore_Xstrata)__ , all of which may be ripe for a rally to early next year.However, the small-caps offer more growth potential. One suggestion for a small-cap, pure play on zinc is the former golden boy ZincOx resources (Aim: ZOX), a company whose management I like.I should also mention Toronto Venture Exchange-listed Vena Resources (__[TSX](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toronto_Stock_Exchange)__ : VEM), a company I have mentioned here before. It is bringing a zinc mine into production in __[Peru](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peru)__  and, according to reports, it has made good progress. Vena has been hammered this year for two reasons.First, there was a lot of (probably misplaced) risk perceived about the new __[Peruvian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peru)__  government being mining unfriendly. Second, Vena is also exploring large uranium deposits and the market fell horribly out of love with uranium after __[Fukushima](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fukushima_Prefecture)__ . But below C$0.20c Vena offers potential value and growth (I hold the stock myself).My latest gold report is now available – as well as looking at ways to buy gold itself, I’ve also tipped some speculative mining stocks that I think are poised to do very well in the coming years, and provided some updates on my previous tips. Get your copy of my gold report here.This article first appeared in Money Morning, the free daily investment email from __[UK](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom)__  investment magazine, __[Moneyweek](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MoneyWeek)__ .
