__[Al-Maliki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nouri_al-Maliki)__  adviser says official who supervised execution is target of probe
__[BAGHDAD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baghdad)__ , __[Iraq](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iraq)__  - __[Iraq](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iraq)__ 's national security adviser told __[NBC News](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBC_News)__  on Wednesday that three individuals have been arrested in connection with a video of __[Saddam Hussein](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saddam_Hussein)__ 's execution that was leaked.
"I can officially now confirm the arrest of three individuals in the case of the execution of __[Saddam Hussein](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saddam_Hussein)__ ," said Iraqi national security adviser __[Mowaffak al-Rubaie](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mowaffak_al-Rubaie)__ .
The arrests came after the announcement that officials were interrogating the person suspected of recording __[Saddam](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saddam_Hussein)__ 's hanging via a mobile phone.
"The person who filmed the execution process has been arrested. ... Now he is under interrogation about the goals of his filming," said an adviser to the prime minister, speaking on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to talk to the media. "He was arrested by __[Iraqi forces](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iraqi_Army)__ ."
The video contained audio of witnesses telling __[Saddam](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saddam_Hussein)__  to "Go to hell" and of the former leader responding to taunts that his tormentors were being unmanly. It surfaced on __[Al-Jazeera](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Al_Jazeera)__  television and the __[Internet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet)__  late Saturday, the day __[Saddam](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saddam_Hussein)__  was hanged.
The __[Associated Press](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Associated_Press)__  quoted an unidentified adviser to Prime Minister __[Nouri al-Maliki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nouri_al-Maliki)__  as saying the man arrested was "an official who supervised the execution."
__[Al-Maliki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nouri_al-Maliki)__  announced Tuesday that he had ordered an investigation into the conduct of the execution team, who could be heard taunting __[Saddam](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saddam_Hussein)__  in the moments before his hanging.
A __[U.S. military](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Armed_Forces)__  spokesman, meanwhile, said the __[United States](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States)__  would have handled the execution differently had it been in charge.
'I did not see him taking pictures'
On Wednesday, an Iraqi prosecutor who was also present at the execution denied a report that he had accused national security adviser __[al-Rubaie](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mowaffak_al-Rubaie)__  of possible responsibility for the leaked video.
"I am not accusing __[Mowaffak al-Rubaie](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mowaffak_al-Rubaie)__ , and I did not see him taking pictures," __[Munqith al-Faroon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/None)__ , a prosecutor in the case that sent __[Saddam](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saddam_Hussein)__  to the gallows, told __[The Associated Press](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Associated_Press)__ .
"But I saw two of the government officials who were ... present during the execution taking all the video of the execution, using the lights that were there for the official taping of the execution. They used mobile phone cameras. I do not know their names, but I would remember their faces," __[al-Faroon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/None)__  said in a telephone interview.
The prosecutor said the two officials were openly taking video pictures, which are believed to be those which appeared on __[Al-Jazeera](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Al_Jazeera)__  satellite and a __[Web site](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Website)__  within hours of __[Saddam](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saddam_Hussein)__ 's execution.
The __[New York Times](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_New_York_Times)__  on Wednesday reported that __[al-Faroon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/None)__  told the newspaper "one of two men he had seen holding a cell phone camera aloft to make a video of Mr. __[Hussein](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saddam_Hussein)__ 's last moments up to and past the point where he fell through the trapdoor was __[Mowaffak al-Rubaie](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mowaffak_al-Rubaie)__ , Mr. __[Maliki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nouri_al-Maliki)__ 's national security adviser."
The __[Times](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_New_York_Times)__  said it had been unable to reach __[al-Rubaie](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mowaffak_al-Rubaie)__  for comment. __[AP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Associated_Press)__  also could not reach him Wednesday. His secretary said the security adviser, a close aide to __[al-Maliki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nouri_al-Maliki)__ , was in __[Najaf](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Najaf)__  and would not return until later.
Chants of 'Muqtada'
__[Al-Faroon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/None)__  said there were 14 Iraqi officials, including himself and another prosecutor, as well as three hangmen present for the execution. All the officials, he said, were flown by U.S. helicopter to the former military intelligence facility where __[Saddam](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saddam_Hussein)__  was put to death in an execution chamber used by his own security men for years.
The prosecutor said he believed all mobile phones had been confiscated before the flight and that some of the officials' bodyguards, who arrived by car, had smuggled the camera phones to the two officials he had seen taking the video pictures.
__[Al-Arabiya](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Al_Arabiya)__  television reported that the person under arrest is one of the guards who was a member of the execution team, according to an __[MSNBC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MSNBC)__  translator. There was no further information about whether the person under arrest was a guard or other official.
Some of the last words __[Saddam](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saddam_Hussein)__  heard, according to the leaked cell phone video, were a chant of "__[Muqtada](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muqtada_al-Sadr)__ , __[Muqtada](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muqtada_al-Sadr)__ , __[Muqtada](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muqtada_al-Sadr)__ ," a reference to __[Muqtada al-Sadr](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muqtada_al-Sadr)__ , the radical anti-American Shiite cleric, whose __[Mahdi Army](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mahdi_Army)__  militia is believed responsible for many killings that have targeted __[Sunnis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunni_Islam)__  and driven many from their homes.
__[Al-Sadr](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muqtada_al-Sadr)__ 's father was killed by __[Saddam](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saddam_Hussein)__ . The militant cleric is a key __[al-Maliki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nouri_al-Maliki)__  backer.
__[U.S.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States)__  response
Maj. Gen. __[William Caldwell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_B._Caldwell)__ , a __[U.S. military](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Armed_Forces)__  spokesman, told reporters Wednesday that the execution would have been handled differently had __[U.S. forces](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Armed_Forces)__  been in charge.
"If you are asking me: 'Would we have done things differently?' Yes, we would have. But that's not our decision. That's the government of __[Iraq](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iraq)__ 's decision," __[Caldwell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_B._Caldwell)__  said.
He added that __[Saddam](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saddam_Hussein)__  was "dignified" and "courteous" as he was transferred from __[US military](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Armed_Forces)__  control to Iraqi custody before he was executed.
"He spoke very well to our military police, as he always had, and when getting off at the prison site he said farewell to his interpreter; he thanked the military police squad," __[Caldwell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_B._Caldwell)__

What we'll want in a president
How will American voters compensate in the 2008 election?
__[WASHINGTON](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington,_D.C.)__  - Now that the 38th president has been laid to rest, the capital can take up the main business of 2007: trying to figure out who will be the 44th.  What type of leader does the country want? Here is my sense of it, based on talking to politicians, strategists and voters here and around the nation.
No ideologues, please
There was a time when __[President George W. Bush](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_W._Bush)__ 's ideological certitude was politically appealing and perhaps functionally necessary. That time has long since passed. The country is tired, even fearful, of leaders with fervent beliefs that seem impervious to new (or even old) facts. Voters see the war in __[Iraq](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iraq)__  as an "idea," not a solution – and Americans do not like ideas that do not work.  Voters likely will view __[Bush](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_W._Bush)__ 's "surge" of troops into __[Iraq](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iraq)__  as new evidence of failure, and the dangers of a leader who depends on preconceived ideas.
Serious student
Presidential elections are a never-ending series of mid-course corrections. Voters look to compensate for the leadership weaknesses of the incumbent. An example comes from the life and career of __[Gerald Ford](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gerald_Ford)__ . In 1976, voters wanted a pure antidote to __[Richard Nixon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Nixon)__ 's paranoid megalomania. Once __[Ford](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gerald_Ford)__  pardoned __[Nixon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Nixon)__ , he could not be that candidate. Instead, Americans chose __[Jimmy Carter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jimmy_Carter)__ , a peanut farmer who had never worked in __[Washington](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington,_D.C.)__ , and who promised never to lie to the __[American people](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Americans)__ . The counterpoint thinking continues. Voters in 2008 are going to want someone who prides himself (or herself) on spending time in the library – who has a hands-on curiosity about the details.
__[Washington](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington,_D.c.)__  experience not necessary
Voters these days not only do not value __[Washington](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington,_D.c.)__  experience – or any office-holding experience – it can make them suspicious. That is what strategists and polltakers for Sen. __[Evan Bayh](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evan_Bayh)__  found when they studied whether he should run for president. They found that his remarkably deep resume – the son of a senator, he was the "boy governor" of __[Indiana](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indiana)__  before going to the __[Senate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Senate)__  – was as handicap. Americans always are dubious about the capital, but that sentiment seems particularly strong. __[Bayh](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evan_Bayh)__  decided not to run. " `__[Washington](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington,_D.C.)__ ' doesn't make the case," said __[Dan Pfeiffer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daniel_Pfeiffer)__ , who worked for __[Bayh](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evan_Bayh)__ .
No more boomer obsessions
Not all elections are about change, but 2008 will be. Americans are moderately upbeat about the country's prospects, but deeply worried about the world – and they have come to realize that they can't separate one from the other. One thing for sure, says __[Pfeiffer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daniel_Pfeiffer)__ , voters are tired of arguing about the culture of the 1960s and other __[Boomer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/None)__  issues.  "There is a sense that the 2004 election was too much about who did or did not do what in __[Vietnam](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vietnam_War)__ ," said __[Pfeiffer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daniel_Pfeiffer)__ , referring to the __[Bush campaign](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_W._Bush_presidential_campaign,_2004)__  against Sen. __[John Kerry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Kerry)__ . In 2000, __[Bush](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_W._Bush)__  won in part by selling himself as a "grown up" Boomer answer to __[Bill Clinton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_Clinton)__ . "Voters are tired of that era and its concerns," said __[Pfeiffer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daniel_Pfeiffer)__  said. "They want to move on."
Know the middle class
Bushes have a congenital family problem with this, and it leaves an opening for someone – of either party – who can prove that he or she really understands the strains of middle class life. It's not just about money, but about cultural assaults and the lack of time for family in an era when both parents or partners need to work. In his forthcoming book, __[Positively American](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/None)__ , Sen. __[Charles Schumer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chuck_Schumer)__  of __[New York](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York)__  imagines the hard life of a fictitious middle class family – and offers a series of governmental proposals to address them. A shrewd student of the American mood, __[Schumer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chuck_Schumer)__

__[Hindus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hindu)__  throng to __[Ganges](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ganges)__  for bathing festival
__[Pilgrims](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pilgrim)__  believe dip in river during six week celebration will cleanse sin
__[ALLAHABAD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allahabad)__ , __[India](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India)__  - Nearly half a million __[Hindus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hindu)__  braved near-freezing temperatures to wash away their sins in the icy waters of the __[Ganges river](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ganges)__  in __[northern India](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_India)__  on Wednesday, the first day of a six-week festival.
As many as 70 million people from __[India](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India)__  and abroad are expected over the whole "__[Ardh Kumbh Mela](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kumbh_Mela)__ " or __[Half Pitcher Festival](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/None)__ , billed as one of the largest gatherings on earth.
Men, women, children, holy men in saffron and the infirm gathered at the confluence of the __[Ganges](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ganges)__ , the __[Yamuna](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yamuna)__  and a mythical third river in __[Allahabad](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allahabad)__  city well before dawn, waiting for the sun to rise for the auspicious bath on the first day of the 42-day event.
They chanted verses from __[Hindu scriptures](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hindu_texts)__  and sang holy songs as they walked towards the bathing areas, some lying prostrate after every few steps to salute the gods.
The festival falls midway between the "__[Maha Kumbh Mela](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kumbh_Mela)__ " or the __[Great Pitcher Festival](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/None)__ , celebrated once every 12 years.
Hindus believe that bathing in the __[Ganges](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ganges)__  during the festivals cleanses them of sin, speeding the way to the attainment of nirvana or the afterlife.
'Like being with God'
After dipping in the polluted but sacred waters, many filled cans, bottles and steel containers for relatives and friends who could not make it. Others sprinkled it on their dry clothes.
"It was a long-cherished desire to take a dip here during the __[Kumbh Mela](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kumbh_Mela)__ ," said __[Naba Kumar Ghosh](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/None)__ , a young school teacher from the eastern Indian state of __[West Bengal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_Bengal)__ . "The experience has been one of fulfillment, a complete cleansing of the inner self."
Shakuntala, a 70-year-old woman who gave only one name, said she traveled all night from the central Indian state of __[Madhya Pradesh](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Madhya_Pradesh)__  to bathe in the __[Ganges](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ganges)__ , just as she has done at every __[Kumbh Mela](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kumbh_Mela)__  over the last 25 years.
"It was a divine experience, a dip in the holy waters is like being with God," she said. "God willing, I will be here for the next '__[Kumbh](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kumbh_Mela)__ ' too".
__[Rama Devi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/None)__ , an old woman from __[Allahabad](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allahabad)__  who could not remember her age, has not missed a single __[Kumbh](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kumbh_Mela)__  and was determined to make it this time despite her inability to walk.
With roads closed to traffic, her 35-year-old son, a soldier in the __[Indian army](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_Army)__ , carried her on his back for the 6-mile walk from their house to the waters.
Tight security
__[Allahabad](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allahabad)__ , in the __[Hindi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hindi)__  heartland state of __[Uttar Pradesh](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uttar_Pradesh)__ , is one of four spots where __[Garuda](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Garuda)__ , the winged steed of __[Hindu god](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hindu_deities)__  __[Vishnu](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vishnu)__ , is said to have rested during a titanic battle with demons over a pitcher of divine nectar of immortality.
__[Garuda](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Garuda)__ 's flight lasted 12 divine days, or 12 years of mortal time, hence the celebration of "__[Maha Kumbh Mela](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kumbh_Mela)__ " every 12 years.
The midway point between two such celebrations is also considered highly favorable because the position of the sun and the moon are the same as during the "__[Maha Kumbh](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kumbh_Mela)__ ".
The "__[Maha Kumbh Mela](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kumbh_Mela)__ " in 1989 attracted 15 million pilgrims and the __[Guinness Book of Records](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guinness_World_Records)__

30 panda cubs born in __[China](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China)__  in 2006
Current total of giant pandas bred in captivity now 217
__[BEIJING](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beijing)__  - A mini-baby boom last year has pushed up the number of pandas bred in captivity in __[China](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China)__  to 217, state media said Wednesday.
Some 34 pandas were born by artificial insemination in 2006 and 30 survived — both record numbers for the endangered species, __[Cao Qingyao](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/None)__ , a spokesman for the __[State Forestry Administration](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_Forestry_Administration_of_the_People's_Republic_of_China)__ , was quoted as saying by the __[Xinhua News Agency](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xinhua_News_Agency)__ .
The previous record was the 21 baby pandas born in __[China](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China)__ 's zoos and breeding centers in 2005.
__[China](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China)__  has been raising pandas through artificial insemination for nearly 50 years, mostly at two research facilities in the southwestern province of __[Sichuan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sichuan)__ .  In 2006, 17 cubs were born at the Wolong Giant Panda Protection and Research Center and 12 at the __[Chengdu Research Base](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/None)__ .  The other panda was bred at the zoo in the southwestern city of __[Chongqing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chongqing)__ .

__[TUSCALOOSA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tuscaloosa,_Alabama)__ , __[Ala.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alabama)__  - __[Nick Saban](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nick_Saban)__  couldn't escape his college roots, so he quit trying.
__[Saban](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nick_Saban)__  was introduced as __[Alabama](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Alabama)__ 's coach on Thursday, touting his championship aspirations and citing his love of college football as a reason for taking a pay cut to leave the __[Miami Dolphins](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miami_Dolphins)__ .
In other words, he said the things __[Crimson Tide](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alabama_Crimson_Tide)__  fans most wanted to hear.
"My heart's here. I love it here," he said. "I like to affect people, and that's why I'm here. This is obviously one of the best places in the country to have an opportunity to do that."
Taking over a program with a rich tradition led by the late coach __[Bear Bryant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bear_Bryant)__ , who won five national titles, __[Saban](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nick_Saban)__  refused to dwell in the past.
"It's what you do now," he said.
His resume features the one thing __[Alabama](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alabama)__  fans hunger for most: A national title. His "championship credentials" — as athletic director __[Mal Moore](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mal_Moore)__  put it — are why the __[Tide](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alabama_Crimson_Tide)__  was willing to offer a reported eight-year deal worth an estimated $32 million plus incentives, the richest in college football.
"I know there's tremendous expectations here," __[Saban](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nick_Saban)__  said. "I can tell you that, however you feel about it, I have even higher expectations for what we want to accomplish. I want to win every game we play."
__[Saban](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nick_Saban)__  led __[Alabama](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Alabama)__  divisional rival __[LSU](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Louisiana_State_University)__  to a national title in 2003 and two __[SEC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southeastern_Conference)__  championships before heading to __[Miami](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miami_Dolphins)__ .
__[Alabama](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Alabama)__  hasn't won the league or even the Western Division since 1999 under __[Mike DuBose](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mike_DuBose)__ . The __[Tide](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alabama_Crimson_Tide)__ 's latest national title — its sixth — came in 1992 under __[Gene Stallings](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_Stallings)__ . __[Alabama](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Alabama)__  has had four losing seasons since '97.
"His teams always play with confidence and pride and I know that in order to win a national championship, a team has to be mentally as well as physically tough," said __[Moore](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mal_Moore)__ , who played and coached under __[Bryant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bear_Bryant)__ . "Coach __[Saban](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nick_Saban)__ 's teams have always possessed those qualities."
As for the big salary, __[Moore](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mal_Moore)__  said, "I just think it was a very crucial hire for us in this time in our history."
Not everyone in __[Alabama](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Alabama)__  was convinced.
"That certainly makes a strong statement in a state that funds education at one of the lowest per-pupil rates of any state in the country," said state Rep. __[Richard Lindsey](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/None)__ , D-Centre, chairman of a House committee that writes the education budget. "I think we've let it get out of hand."
But the school's faculty senate president, chemistry professor __[John Vincent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/None)__ , had a more positive view.
"The money doesn't come out of the academic side of the university. The academic side is self sufficient," he said. "Of course I would like to see these kinds of benefits available on the academic side, but this hiring offers much to the university."
__[Vincent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/None)__  said having a high-profile coach like __[Saban](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nick_Saban)__  would create more interest in the __[University of Alabama](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Alabama)__ , which would bring more interest and money to the academic side.

Stocks end back-and-forth day slightly higher
__[NEW YORK](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_City)__  — Stocks finished an erratic session mixed Tuesday as higher commodity prices lifted energy and materials shares.
Major stock indexes had their third straight advance, reaching new 13-month highs, but there were more declining shares than advancers on the __[New York Stock Exchange](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Stock_Exchange)__  and the __[Nasdaq Stock Market](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NASDAQ)__ . Stocks had zigzagged for much of the day on mixed news from retailers and industrial production.
A rebound in the dollar after three down days kept investors' appetite for stocks in check. An eight-month weakening of the dollar has been lifting commodities prices and shares of __[U.S.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States)__  exporters, which benefit from stronger foreign demand for their goods when the dollar falls. Record-low U.S. interest rates have also driven investors to seek higher returns in stocks and commodities, lifting share prices.
Trading volume remained light, signaling a lack of strong conviction behind the market's moves.
Investors focused on retailers' earnings reports for insight into one of the market's biggest worries: how much consumers are spending. __[Home Depot Inc.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Home_Depot)__ , __[Saks Inc.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saks_Incorporated)__  and __[Target Corp.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Target_Corporation)__  all reported better-than-expected third-quarter results but also said they remain cautious ahead of the holiday shopping season.
"Despite the dramatic rally in the stock market, we still see the consumer operating at recessionary levels," said __[Uri Landesman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/None)__ , chief equity strategist and senior portfolio manager at __[ING Investment Management](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ING_Group)__  in __[New York](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_City)__ . Stocks have surged in the past eight months as investors anticipate a recovery in the economy.
Stocks jumped Monday on a government report that retail sales rebounded in October. Investors are looking for signs that consumer spending, one of the biggest drivers of the U.S. economy, will recover during the holidays.
A report on industrial production weighed on the market. __[The Fed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Reserve_System)__  said output at the nation's factories, mines and utilities rose 0.1 percent in October, less than the 0.4 percent predicted by economists polled by __[Thomson Reuters](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomson_Reuters)__ .
Meanwhile, signs of inflation remained muted, a welcome sign for the economy. The __[Labor Department](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Department_of_Labor)__ 's __[Producer Price Index](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Producer_price_index)__ , which measures inflation at the wholesale level, rose less than expected in October. The 0.3 percent rise was smaller than economists had forecast.
"The market is saying inflation is not an issue," said __[Tim Courtney](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/None)__ , chief investment officer at __[Oklahoma City](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oklahoma_City)__ -based __[Burns Advisory Group](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/None)__ . He said that's a signal interest rates will remain low.
The __[Dow Jones industrial average](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dow_Jones_Industrial_Average)__  rose 30.46, or 0.3 percent, to 10,437.42. It was the ninth gain in 10 days for the __[Dow](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dow_Jones_Industrial_Average)__  and its highest close since Oct. 2, 2008, when it ended at 10,482.85. The Dow jumped 136 points Monday after the retail sales report.
The broader __[Standard & Poor's 500 ind](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S&P_500)__ ex rose 1.02, or 0.1 percent, to 1,110.32, while the __[Nasdaq](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NASDAQ)__  composite index rose 5.93, or 0.3 percent, to 2,203.78.
Falling stocks outpaced those that rose 8-to-7 on the __[NYSE](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Stock_Exchange)__ , where volume came to 972 million shares compared with 1.1 billion Monday.
The __[Dow](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dow_Jones_Industrial_Average)__  is up 725 points, or 7.5 percent, this month. That has some analysts saying the market has been rising too fast given problems like unemployment still facing the economy. For the year, the Dow is up 18.9 percent after rebounding from a 12-year low in March.
A bounce in crude oil helped energy stocks. Oil rose 24 cents to settle at $79.14 per barrel on the __[New York Mercantile Exchange](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Mercantile_Exchange)__ .
Gold climbed 20 cents to $1,139.40. Gains in other metals spurred gains of materials companies. Platinum jumped $17.90 to $1,459 an ounce.
Bond prices edged higher to push yields lower. The yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury note slipped to 3.33 percent from 3.34 percent late Monday.
Among energy and materials stocks, __[Exxon Mobil Corp.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ExxonMobil)__  rose 60 cents to $75.03, while __[United States Steel Corp.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U.S._Steel)__  rose 93 cents, or 2.3 percent, to $42.30.
__[Home Depot](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Home_Depot)__  fell 66 cents, or 2.4 percent, to $26.99, while __[Saks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saks_Incorporated)__  rose 26 cents, or 4.1 percent, to $5.67. __[Target](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Target_Corporation)__  fell $1.52, or 3 percent, to $48.77. __[Pacific Sunwear of California Inc.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PacSun)__  tumbled $1.13, or 22.6 percent, to $3.88 after its sales forecast fell short of expectations.
The __[Russell 2000 index](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russell_2000)__  of smaller companies slipped 0.53, or 0.1 percent, to 602.34.
Overseas, __[Japan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japan)__ 's __[Nikkei stock average](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nikkei_225)__  fell 0.6 percent. __[Britain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Britain)__ 's __[FTSE 100](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FTSE_100_Index)__  fell 0.7 percent, __[Germany](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germany)__ 's __[DAX](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DAX)__  index fell 0.5 percent, and __[France](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/France)__ 's __[CAC-40](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CAC_40)__

Resolution to imbibe less goes awry — already
Myriad of conflicting medical studies are enough to drive this writer to drink
The fruitcake's been digested, the gift cards are empty, and now it's time to face the most grueling holiday task of all: the annual reassessment. Do I need to exercise more? Spend less? Set aside more quality time for friends and family? The resolution list goes on and on — much like that interminable karaoke version of "__[Santa Baby](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Santa_Baby)__ " at this year's holiday party.
Unfortunately, since I was the one holding the microphone, this year's resolution seems painfully clear: Cut back on the alcohol intake.
Not that I drink a lot — usually just a glass of wine with dinner, if that but I've read that even one drink a day can adversely affect my health.
Also, a recent study by the __[Mayo Clinic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mayo_Clinic)__  found that women's bodies are less adept at breaking down alcohol than men's. As a result, the more we drink, the more we risk heart disease, cancer, cirrhosis of the liver, and, perhaps the most chilling side effect of all — kissing our skinny jeans goodbye forever.
But how much alcohol is too much? There's the rub. The answer seems to depend on which study you read. The __[Mayo Clinic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mayo_Clinic)__  study says one drink a day is OK for "younger women who aren't planning a pregnancy" and that "postmenopausal women should limit themselves to less." But what about those of us who don't fit in either category?
Looking for a definitive answer, I turned to another study, this one conducted by a group of doctors at __[Stony Brook University](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stony_Brook_University)__  in __[New York](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_City)__ . But their finding that drinking three glasses of red wine a week reduces the risk of colorectal cancer only confused matters further.
Who to believe?
Should I cut back on alcohol entirely in order to fend off heart disease, liver problems and dreaded weight gain (not to mention potential blackmail opportunities by family, friends and co-workers) or suck down three or more glasses a week to keep the colorectal cancer at bay?
Or should I listen to the doctors the __[Goteborg University](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Gothenburg)__  in __[Sweden](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sweden)__ , who found that mice that had ingested low levels of alcohol on a daily basis showed a significantly lower risk of developing rheumatoid arthritis than mice that just drank water. Obsessed, I started digging through medical journals and online health stories until the studies began to stack up like swizzle sticks at a company-hosted bar.
In __[London](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London)__ , researchers found that people who drank alcohol have a lower risk of developing non-__[Hodgkin's lymphoma](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hodgkin's_lymphoma)__ , but the risk of cancer of the mouth, esophagus and liver actually increases.
At __[Ohio State University](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ohio_State_University)__ , a study showed that drinking moderately (such as a couple of drinks a day) improved the memories of laboratory rats, although a study at the __[University of Missouri](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Missouri)__

Upgrade makes aging __[Mars rovers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mars_rover)__  smarter
Engineers transmitted new software to the rovers' onboard computers
__[LOS ANGELES](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles)__  - The twin __[Mars rovers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mars_rover)__  are getting wiser with age.
Engineers have transmitted new flight software to the rovers' onboard computers — just in time for the third anniversary of their landing. The software is aimed at boosting their intelligence and independence so that they can roll around the __[Red Planet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mars)__  with less help from humans.
"We're teaching an old dog new tricks," said __[John Callas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/None)__ , the mission project manager with the __[Jet Propulsion Laboratory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jet_Propulsion_Laboratory)__ , the __[NASA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NASA)__  agency in charge of the rovers.
Among the rovers' new skills is the ability to automatically recognize and transmit to __[Earth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth)__  photographs that they take of swirling dust devils or floating clouds. They can also independently decide whether it is safe to extend its robotic arm to sample a piece of rock.
Before, scientists had to painstakingly dissect thousands of images just to find the frames they need and decide for the rovers whether to use their arms. The high-tech upgrades should help save time — as much as a day because scientists on __[Earth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth)__  don't have to study a rock before sending commands to the robot to pick it up.
If successful, the changes could get incorporated into future __[Mars](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mars)__  missions.
__[Spirit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spirit_(rover))__  and __[Opportunity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opportunity_(rover))__  were also fitted with a new navigation system that allows them to think several steps ahead when faced with an obstacle, allowing them to back out of a dead end or even navigate a maze on their own, __[Callas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/None)__  said. The geologic robots have previously tackled one problem at a time.
__[Spirit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spirit_(rover))__  landed three years ago Wednesday and __[Opportunity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opportunity_(rover))__  on Jan. 24, 2004. Entering their fourth year of exploration, both golf cart-sized vehicles have long outlasted their missions, originally planned for about three months. While scientists are impressed by the rovers' longevity, they admit the robots could die at any time.
The rovers' biggest accomplishment is uncovering geologic evidence that water once flowed on __[Mars](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mars)__ . __[Spirit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spirit_(rover))__  is currently studying rocks and soil samples near a __[Martian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martian)__  ridge while __[Opportunity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opportunity_(rover))__

__[Gerald Ford](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gerald_Ford)__  laid to rest in __[Michigan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michigan)__ 
Burial of ex-president, 'hometown hero' caps eight days of mourning
__[GRAND RAPIDS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grand_Rapids,_Michigan)__ , __[Mich.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michigan)__  - __[Gerald R. Ford](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gerald_Ford)__  was laid to rest on the grounds of his presidential museum Wednesday after eight days of mourning and remembrance that spanned the country, from the __[California desert](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deserts_of_California)__  to the nation's capital and back to __[Ford](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gerald_Ford)__ 's boyhood home.
The sunset burial capped the official mourning for the 38th president after a 17-hour viewing Tuesday night and Wednesday at the museum in his hometown.
At a graveside service that included a 21-gun salute and a 21-aircraft flyover, __[Vice President](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vice_President_of_the_United_States)__  __[Dick Cheney](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dick_Cheney)__  presented former first lady __[Betty Ford](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Betty_Ford)__  with the __[American flag](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flag_of_the_United_States)__  that was draped over her husband's casket.
Earlier, __[Ford](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gerald_Ford)__  was remembered as a man not afraid to laugh, make tough decisions or listen to the advice of his independent wife in eulogies delivered during a funeral at the church the couple attended for six decades.
An honor guard carried the casket inside __[Grace Episcopal Church](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/None)__ , where __[Ford](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gerald_Ford)__ 's defense secretary, __[Donald Rumsfeld](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Rumsfeld)__ , and __[Ford](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gerald_Ford)__ 's successor, __[Jimmy Carter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jimmy_Carter)__ , recalled his public service.
__[Rumsfeld](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Rumsfeld)__ : 'He was one of us' His widow wiped away tears as she sat with the couple's four children and more than 300 dignitaries and family friends, including golfing legend __[Jack Nicklaus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jack_Nicklaus)__ .
"He was one of us," __[Rumsfeld](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Rumsfeld)__  said, "And that made him special and needed in a dark and dangerous hour for our nation."
__[Rumsfeld](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Rumsfeld)__ , who recently left his post as __[President Bush](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_W._Bush)__ 's defense secretary, remembered __[Ford](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gerald_Ford)__  as a courageous and steady leader who healed the nation after __[Watergate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Watergate_scandal)__ .
__[Rumsfeld](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Rumsfeld)__  said the __[Navy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Navy)__  is considering naming a new aircraft carrier after __[Ford](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gerald_Ford)__ , a Navy veteran. A decision is expected later this month.
"How fitting it would be that the name __[Gerald R. Ford](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gerald_Ford)__  will patrol the high seas for decades to come in defense of the nation he loved so much," he said.
Carter described the close personal friendship he and __[Ford](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gerald_Ford)__  developed over the years.
"I relished his sound advice," __[Carter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jimmy_Carter)__  said as his wife, __[Rosalynn](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rosalynn_Carter)__ , cried. "I want to thank my predecessor for all he did to heal our land."
Thousands of flag-waving mourners lined the roads under sunny skies as the motorcade bearing __[Ford](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gerald_Ford)__ 's casket traveled between his presidential museum in downtown __[Grand Rapids](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grand_Rapids,_Michigan)__  to the church, before returning to the museum.
Viewing period extended
The viewing had to be extended Wednesday until nearly noon so everyone in line could pay their respects. Some 57,000 mourners waited hours to file past the flag-draped casket during the night. Some stopped and made silent prayers.
"We're here to honor him," said __[Philip Bareham](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/None)__  of __[Lansing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lansing,_Michigan)__ , who was the last person to view the casket and whose parents were among __[Ford](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gerald_Ford)__ 's earliest supporters and political allies. "We just love this family. They are so down to earth."
__[Ford](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gerald_Ford)__  represented __[Grand Rapids](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grand_Rapids,_Michigan)__  in __[Congress](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Congress)__  for 25 years. His family had belonged  to __[Grace Episcopal Church](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/None)__  since the early 1940s.
__[Richard Norton Smith](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Norton_Smith)__ , an author, presidential historian and former director of __[Ford](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gerald_Ford)__ 's museum and library, reminded mourners how important __[Ford](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gerald_Ford)__ 's hometown was to him.
"__[Grand Rapids](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grand_Rapids,_Michigan)__  returned his affection many times over," which was "unforgettably demonstrated by the tens of thousands who stood in line for hours outside the museum, braving the cold to assure that his last night was anything but lonely," __[Smith](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Norton_Smith)__  said.
Draped over the back of one pew at the funeral was a blue blanket with the letter "M" emblazoned on it, symbolizing __[Ford](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gerald_Ford)__ 's alma mater, the __[University of Michigan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Michigan)__ , where he played football for national championship teams in 1932 and 1933.
Many of the mourners at the museum and lining the roads during his funeral procession on Wednesday wore __[Michigan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michigan)__  hats and sweat shirts in his honor.
__[Ford](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gerald_Ford)__ , who became president after __[Richard Nixon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Nixon)__  resigned, died Dec. 26 at his home in __[Rancho Mirage](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rancho_Mirage,_California)__ , __[Calif.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California)__

__[Chertoff](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Chertoff)__  pledges to address communications
Homeland security secretary acknowledges friction has hindered progress
__[WASHINGTON](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington,_D.C.)__  - The nation's homeland security chief pledged Wednesday that 75 metropolitan areas would have advanced disaster communications systems by 2009 but acknowledged that friction among emergency agencies continues to hinder progress.
"We are determined to get this job done in the next two years," __[Homeland Security](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Department_of_Homeland_Security)__  Secretary __[Michael Chertoff](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Chertoff)__  said at a news briefing.
He did not say how much the effort would cost, but so far the government has distributed more than $2.9 billion to communities around the country with mixed results. __[Democrats](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States))__  who will control __[Congress](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Congress)__  this year have also promised to make communications upgrades a priority, but have provided little detail.
__[Chertoff](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Chertoff)__  released a survey of how well the 75 __[U.S.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States)__  communities have prepared their first responders to communicate during a catastrophe. More than five years after the attacks of Sept. 11, 2001, exposed severe weaknesses in the ability of emergency workers to communicate with each other, the report gave only six of the areas studied the highest grades.
Portions of the report had been obtained Tuesday by __[The Associated Press](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Associated_Press)__ .
'Longstanding cultural differences' __[Chertoff](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Chertoff)__  said Wednesday that since the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks, agencies have tried to overcome old turf rivalries that can hamper emergency work.
"In some communities, not all, there are some longstanding cultural differences between different kinds of responders," including police, firefighters and medical personnel, __[Chertoff](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Chertoff)__  said. "I think that is a challenge and that culture has been a challenge."
The report found that while emergency agencies in more than 60 percent of the communities studied had the ability to talk to each other during a crisis, only 21 percent overall showed "the seamless use" of equipment needed to also communicate with state and federal officials.
The report's highest ratings went to the __[Washington](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington,_D.C.)__ , __[D.C.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington,_D.C.)__ , area; __[San Diego](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Diego)__ ; __[Minneapolis-St. Paul](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minneapolis–Saint_Paul)__ ; __[Columbus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Columbus,_Ohio)__ , __[Ohio](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ohio)__ ; __[Sioux Falls](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sioux_Falls,_South_Dakota)__ , __[S.D.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Dakota)__ ; and __[Laramie County](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laramie_County,_Wyoming)__ , __[Wyo.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wyoming)__ 
The lowest scores went to __[Chicago](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago)__ ; __[Cleveland](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cleveland)__ ; __[Baton Rouge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baton_Rouge,_Louisiana)__ , __[La.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Louisiana)__ ; __[Mandan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mandan,_North_Dakota)__ , __[N.D.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Dakota)__ ; and __[American Samoa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Samoa)__ . The report includes large and small cities and their suburbs, along with __[U.S. territories](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Territories_of_the_United_States)__ .
In an overview, the report says all 75 areas surveyed have policies in place for helping their emergency workers communicate. But it also finds that "formalized governance (leadership and planning) across regions has lagged."
The study is likely to add fuel to what looms as a battle in __[Congress](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Congress)__  this year. __[Democrats](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States))__  who take over the majority this week have promised to try fixing the problem emergency agencies have communicating with each other but have not said specifically what they will do, how much it will cost or how they will pay for it.
"Five years after 9/11, we continue to turn a deaf ear to gaps in interoperable communications," — the term used for emergency agencies' abilities to talk to each other, said Sen. __[Charles Schumer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chuck_Schumer)__ , D-N.Y. "If it didn't have such potentially devastating consequences, it would be laughable."
The attacks of Sept. 11, 2001, revealed major problems in how well emergency agencies were able to talk to each other during a catastrophe. Many firefighters climbing the __[World Trade Center](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Trade_Center)__  towers died when they were unable to hear police radio warnings to leave the crumbling buildings.
The report says first responders in __[New York](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_City)__  now have well-established systems to communicate with each other — but not the best, most advanced possible. Thirteen __[U.S.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States)__  cities score better than __[New York](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_City)__ .
Judged in three categories
Communities were judged in three categories: operating procedures in place, use of communications systems and how effectively local governments have coordinated in preparation for a disaster.
Most of the areas surveyed included cities and their surrounding communities, based on the assumption that in a major crisis emergency personnel from all local jurisdictions would respond.
The areas with the six best scores were judged advanced in all three categories. The cities with the lowest grades had reached the early implementation stage for only one category, and intermediate grades in the other two categories.
The __[Chicago](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago)__  Office of Emergency Management and Communications took issue with the report's methodology and findings.
"We strongly disagree with the results of this study, and feel that the parameters of the study were inconsistent and limited," the statement said.
__[Tammy Lapp](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/None)__ , the emergency coordinator for __[Mandan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mandan,_North_Dakota)__  and __[Morton County](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morton_County,_North_Dakota)__ , __[N.D.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Dakota)__

__[Riley](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pat_Riley)__  to have surgery on right knee
__[MIAMI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miami)__  - __[Pat Riley](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pat_Riley)__  is taking a break from a season that has left him limping and in pain.
The __[Miami Heat](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miami_Heat)__  coach began an indefinite leave of absence Wednesday because of hip and knee problems, choosing assistant __[Ron Rothstein](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ron_Rothstein)__  to fill his spot on an interim basis.
__[Riley](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pat_Riley)__  will have surgery Friday to remove floating chips in his right knee. Surgery on his hip, the malady that hurts him most now, is not yet scheduled. The 61-year-old coach doesn't know how long he'll be out.
"I'm going to be displaced for a while, but not disconnected at all," he said.
__[Miami](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miami_Heat)__ 's record fell to 13-18 on Wednesday after a 110-95 loss to the __[Los Angeles Clippers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles_Clippers)__ . Already this season, the __[Heat](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miami_Heat)__  have seen __[Shaquille O'Neal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shaquille_O'Neal)__ , __[Dwyane Wade](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dwyane_Wade)__  and __[Jason Williams](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jason_Williams_(basketball,_born_1975))__  — perhaps the three biggest keys in last year's championship run — miss many games with injuries.
And now it's __[Riley](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pat_Riley)__ 's turn.
"We have a championship team that is sideways right now, so this is going to be a great challenge," __[Riley](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pat_Riley)__  said. "Keep your notebooks open. We'll see how it plays out."
__[Riley](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pat_Riley)__ , who also is the __[Heat](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miami_Heat)__  president, resigned as coach shortly before the 2003-04 season, then returned to the bench in December 2005, replacing __[Stan Van Gundy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stan_Van_Gundy)__  and postponing right hip replacement surgery.
In September, after deciding against having offseason surgery, __[Riley](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pat_Riley)__  said he didn't expect to need the operation this season, but the pain has apparently worsened in recent weeks.
"I'm just tired of the pain and the medication," __[Riley](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pat_Riley)__  said.
__[Riley](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pat_Riley)__  was asked if the knee injury, or at its severity, stems in any way from him reportedly kicking a locker room door last week following a loss in __[Chicago](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago)__ .
"What I do in the locker room really has always been my business," __[Riley](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pat_Riley)__  said.
__[Heat](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miami_Heat)__  center __[Alonzo Mourning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alonzo_Mourning)__  said he didn't know if the kick made __[Riley](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pat_Riley)__ 's condition worse.
"Typical Riles," __[Mourning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alonzo_Mourning)__  said. "All the years that he's coached me I've seen him tear a lot of things up."
__[Rothstein](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ron_Rothstein)__  was the Heat's first head coach in the 1988-89 season and lasted three years with the expansion franchise, finishing with a 57-189 record. His last full stint as an NBA head coach was with the 1992-93 __[Detroit Pistons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Detroit_Pistons)__ , a team he guided to a 40-42 record, and he filled in for __[Riley](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pat_Riley)__  for the final two games of last season while the coach visited his ailing mother.
"Listen, I haven't been in the first chair in an NBA game since 1993," said __[Rothstein](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ron_Rothstein)__ , who also coached the __[WNBA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Women's_National_Basketball_Association)__ 's __[Miami Sol](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miami_Sol)__  for three seasons. "Coaching the __[WNBA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Women's_National_Basketball_Association)__  was a totally different story. I don't mean to demean that at all. But this is different. So, I'm sort of curious to see how I'll feel and how I'll handle it."
__[Riley](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pat_Riley)__ 's frustration has grown as the __[Heat](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miami_Heat)__  have struggled this season, remaining mired below .500. Plus, on Wednesday he deactivated forwards __[Antoine Walker](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antoine_Walker)__  and __[James Posey](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Posey)__  because neither met a Jan. 1 deadline for a team conditioning goal regarding body fat.
But he said Wednesday the team's record did not factor into his decision to temporarily step aside now.
"We've had defensive lapses that are mind-boggling to me," __[Riley](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pat_Riley)__  said. "The offensive output will be corrected when __[Shaq](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shaquille_O'Neal)__  and __[Dwyane](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dwyane_Wade)__  and everybody's healthy. I don't think there's been any question about that. But I haven't been happy with our overall effort and defense all year long."
The __[Heat](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miami_Heat)__  haven't had their preseason projected starting five together for any games yet this season because of all the injuries.
"We're all frustrated that we're not doing as well as we're supposed to be doing," __[O'Neal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shaquille_O'Neal)__  said. "But there's a lot of iffy factors involved with that. Very soon, everybody will be back. That'll be the day we're looking forward to."
__[Wade](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dwyane_Wade)__ , last season's finals __[MVP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Most_Valuable_Player)__ , was expected to miss his third straight game Wednesday because of a sprained wrist. A six-game Western swing begins Friday in __[Phoenix](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phoenix,_Arizona)__  and the team hopes to get __[O'Neal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shaquille_O'Neal)__  back by the end of the trip.
"I haven't been happy about the situation," __[Riley](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pat_Riley)__  said. "I don't think anybody is. I hope that when everybody gets healthy, including myself, it'll rectify itself."
__[Riley](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pat_Riley)__  has a career record of 1,164-607, including Wednesday's loss, which counts against him. Last season's title run was vindication for __[Riley](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pat_Riley)__ , who made sweeping roster changes after the 2005 playoffs. The championship was __[Riley](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pat_Riley)__ 's seventh and his fifth as a head coach, but his first since 1988 with the Showtime-era __[Los Angeles Lakers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles_Lakers)__ .
Other marquee coaches have dealt with similar issues. __[Larry Brown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Larry_Brown_(basketball))__  missed 17 games with the __[Pistons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Detroit_Pistons)__  two seasons ago following hip surgery, and __[Lakers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles_Lakers)__  coach __[Phil Jackson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phil_Jackson)__  missed about a month before this season after his hip was replaced.
But, __[Riley](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pat_Riley)__

Thousands of holiday travelers without luggage
Fog, technical glitch at __[London's Heathrow Airport](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London_Heathrow_Airport)__  snarls baggage system
__[LONDON](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London)__  - Thousands of airline passengers still have not received their luggage after fog disrupted flights at __[London's Heathrow Airport](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London_Heathrow_Airport)__  late last year, airline officials said Wednesday.
The chaos was compounded when faults developed with a baggage belt at __[Heathrow](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London_Heathrow_Airport)__ 's Terminal 4, said __[British Airways](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Airways)__ , the airline that was worst affected.
__[BA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Airways)__  said Wednesday it still had "several thousand" bags that have not been delivered to their owners.
Many are still stacked at __[Heathrow](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London_Heathrow_Airport)__ 's Terminal 1 and Terminal 4, and __[BA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Airways)__  is now using freight planes and volunteers to deliver them to their owners.
The problem began before the __[Christmas holiday](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christmas_Holiday)__  with a fault on a baggage belt at Terminal 4, a __[BA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Airways)__  spokesman said on condition of anonymity. That caused an initial backlog, and about 8,000 bags were not delivered, he said.
The fog at __[Heathrow](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heathrow,_London)__  caused further problems, and there was another Terminal 4 baggage belt problem on Dec. 29 — leading to about 10,000 bags being undelivered, the spokesman said.
Over the holiday season, the airline dealt with about 75,000 bags a day at __[Heathrow](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heathrow,_London)__  and handled about 1 million passengers, the spokesman said.
The baggage problem coincided with changes in working practices for __[BA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Airways)__

5 charged in __[Texas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Texas)__  airport luggage thefts
Workers at baggage-handling firm accused after bags found in pet store bin
__[HOUSTON](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Houston)__  - Five employees of a baggage-handling contractor have been charged in the thefts of 158 pieces of luggage from __[George Bush Intercontinental Airport](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Bush_Intercontinental_Airport)__ , police said Tuesday.
Sixty-eight pieces of luggage were discovered in a __[Houston](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Houston)__  pet store's trash bin on Dec. 26. __[Police](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Police)__  said the luggage appeared to have been picked over, with any valuables stolen.
Ninety more pieces of stolen luggage were found at two undisclosed locations over the weekend, Houston Police Capt. __[Rick Bownds](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/None)__  said.
Charged with engaging in organized criminal activity were twin brothers __[Manuel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/None)__  and __[Ricardo Aguilar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/None)__ , 23; __[Carlos Osorio](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/None)__ , 24; __[Erick Perez](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/None)__ , 29; and __[Daniel Venegas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/None)__ , who turns 26 this week. The Aguilar brothers, __[Osorio](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/None)__  and __[Perez](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/None)__  were being held at the __[Harris County Jail](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/None)__  on $20,000 bond. Information was not available for __[Venegas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/None)__ .
It was not clear Tuesday whether the five men had hired attorneys.
__[Bownds](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/None)__  said the men worked for __[Menzies Aviation Group](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/None)__ , a company that handles baggage for connecting flights across the __[United States](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States)__ . The company was cooperating with the investigation, police said.
A telephone message left with the company's __[London](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London)__  office was not immediately returned Tuesday night.
Investigators and the airlines were trying to determine the owners of the bags and figure out what might have been stolen, __[Bownds](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/None)__

Five healthy resolutions for 2007
Follow nutritionist __[Joy Bauer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joy_Bauer)__ 's recommendations for a better year
Have you made a __[New Year's resolution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Year's_resolution)__  yet? Have you broken it already? Don't despair. __[Nutritionist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nutritionist)__  __[Joy Bauer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joy_Bauer)__  has created 5 healthy, and simple, resolutions we all should have on our "to do" list for the new year:
__[Joy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joy_Bauer)__ 's Healthy Resolutions for 2007:
1. Make YOURSELF a priority
*Shop for healthy foods your body needs
*Get enough sleep
*Exercise regularly
2. Know your numbers
Ring in the __[New Year](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Year)__  with a pledge to visit your doctor and learn your blood pressure reading and fasting cholesterol, triglyceride and blood sugar levels.  The sooner you know where you stand, the sooner you can take action to make corrections.
*  Optimal blood pressure equal to or < 120 / 80 mmHg
*  Total cholesterol  < 200 mg/dL
*  __[LDL-Cholesterol](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Low-density_lipoprotein)__   < 100 mg/dL
*  __[HDL-Cholesterol](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High-density_lipoprotein)__   40 mg/dL or higher
*  Cholesterol ratio  below 5
*  __[Triglycerides](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triglyceride)__   < 150 mg/dL
*  __[Blood Sugars](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_sugar)__   < 100 mg/dL
3. Up your ante!
Antioxidants are naturally occurring compounds found in plant based foods. Antioxidants help the body fight many serious conditions, including cancer and heart disease, by thwarting the action of harmful free radicals. According to a study published in the __[American Journal of Clinical Nutrition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_American_Journal_of_Clinical_Nutrition)__ , July 2006, the following foods are among the richest in antioxidants. Go out of your way to incorporate them into your daily diet.
1. __[Blackberries](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blackberry)__ 
2. __[Walnuts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walnut)__ 
3. __[Strawberries](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strawberry)__ 
4. __[Artichokes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artichoke)__  
5. __[Cranberries](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cranberry)__ 
6. __[Raspberries](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raspberry)__ 
7. __[Blueberries](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blueberry)__ 
8. Cloves, ground
4. Incorporate whole grains
2007 is the year to stop buying refined, white starch. Instead, embrace brown rice, whole wheat pasta, whole grain bread and other healthy grain varieties like millet, faro, and amaranth.
Learn how to buy the right bread! Many consumers believe they're buying the right type of bread but are often confused. According to a __[Sara Lee Food & Beverage sur](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/None)__ vey, 73% of consumers who were asked what type of bread they had in the house said "whole wheat bread," but after checking the label realized that they mistakenly thought "enriched wheat" meant whole grain.
Look a "whole" lot closer at labels in the bread aisle - it must say 100% __[Whole Wheat](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whole_grain)__  or 100% __[Whole Grain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whole_grain)__ , or list the word WHOLE as one of the first ingredients on the label.
5. Slow the pace - lose fat on your waist
In an interesting experiment that was presented at the 2006 __[Annual Scientific Meeting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/None)__  a __[NAASO](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/None)__ , women were invited to eat a pasta lunch on two different days. On one day, the women were given a small spoon and asked to take small bites, put the spoon down between bites, and chew each bite at least 15 times. On the second day, the women were given a large spoon and asked to eat as quickly as possible without stopping between bites. On both occasions, the women ate until they felt comfortably full. When researchers measured how many calories the women ate, they found that women ate 67 more calories when they ate quickly than when they ate slowly. Although this may not sound like much, calories add up.
An additional 134 calories per day, means 48,910 calories per year…. that's potentially 14 pounds (lost or gained!).

__[Home Depot](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Home_Depot)__  CEO __[Nardelli](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Nardelli)__  quits
Home-improvement retailer's chief executive had been criticized over pay
__[ATLANTA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlanta)__  - __[Bob Nardelli](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Nardelli)__  said he had no intention of stepping down. His board said it didn't want anybody else. But in the end, analysts said, the criticism over Nardelli's hefty pay and __[The Home Depot Inc.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Home_Depot)__ 's poor stock performance forced a change of heart.
__[Nardelli](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Nardelli)__  abruptly resigned as chairman and chief executive of the world's largest home improvement store chain after six years at the helm, the company said Wednesday.
He didn't leave empty-handed: the __[Atlanta](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlanta)__ -based company said __[Nardelli](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Nardelli)__  would receive a severance package worth roughly $210 million, an amount decried by some lawmakers as a golden parachute that sends the wrong message to investors.
"It's a sign of being totally out of touch," said Rep. __[Barney Frank](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barney_Frank)__ , D-Mass., the incoming chairman of the __[House Financial Services Committee](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_House_Committee_on_Financial_Services)__ . "They don't understand the extent to which they make the American public angry."
__[Frank](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barney_Frank)__  said he would push for legislation requiring public companies to allow shareholders to have a say in compensation and severance for senior executives. At __[Home Depot](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Home_Depot)__ 's annual meeting last May, shareholder proposals to give investors a say on the CEO's pay and to restrict retirement benefits for senior executives were rejected.
__[Nardelli](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Nardelli)__ 's severance package includes a cash payment of $20 million and the acceleration of unvested deferred stock awards currently valued at roughly $77 million. A __[Home Depot](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Home_Depot)__  spokesman said the timing of the resignation, which was effective Tuesday, had no bearing on the amount in the package.
The total package is seven times the $30 million __[Home Depot](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Home_Depot)__  set aside last June for stores and employees that provide good customer service. Home Depot has 2,127 stores and 355,000 employees in the __[United States](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States)__ , __[Canada](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canada)__ , __[Mexico](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mexico)__  and __[China](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China)__ .
__[Home Depot](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Home_Depot)__  said __[Nardelli](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Nardelli)__  was being replaced by __[Frank Blake](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frank_Blake)__ , its vice chairman, effective immediately.
__[Home Depot](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Home_Depot)__  co-founder __[Bernie Marcus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bernard_Marcus)__ , who had a hand in hiring __[Nardelli](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Nardelli)__ , said he supports the board's decision to replace __[Nardelli](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Nardelli)__  with __[Blake](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frank_Blake)__ .
"My concern is what happens in the future, and I feel very good about it," said __[Marcus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bernard_Marcus)__ , who no longer works for __[Home Depot](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Home_Depot)__  in any official capacity but remains one of the company's largest individual shareholders.
Asked about the severance payout, __[Marcus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bernard_Marcus)__  said the amount won't be that big a deal in the long-run if the company's stock price improves.
"It's like the old story, if the stock goes up 10 points, who's going to care?" __[Marcus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bernard_Marcus)__  said.
__[Nardelli](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Nardelli)__ , a former college football player, became CEO of __[Home Depot](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Home_Depot)__  in December 2000 after being passed over for the top job at __[General Electric Co.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_Electric)__ , where __[Nardelli](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Nardelli)__  had been a senior executive.
__[Blake](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frank_Blake)__ 's appointment is permanent, __[Home Depot](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Home_Depot)__  spokesman __[Jerry Shields](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/None)__  said. The company declined to make __[Blake](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frank_Blake)__  available for comment, and messages left for __[Nardelli](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Nardelli)__  with his secretary and on his wife's cell phone were not immediately returned.
__[Home Depot](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Home_Depot)__  shares rose 91 cents, or 2.3 percent, to close at $41.07 on the __[New York Stock Exchange](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Stock_Exchange)__ , near the upper end of their 52-week range of $32.85 to $43.95. Before Wednesday's news, __[Home Depot](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Home_Depot)__ 's stock had been down more than 3 percent on a split-adjusted basis since __[Nardelli](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Nardelli)__  took over.
Nardelli's sudden departure was stunning in that he told __[The Associated Press](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Associated_Press)__  as recently as Sept. 1 that he had no intention of leaving, and a key director said that the board was pleased with __[Nardelli](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Nardelli)__  despite the uproar by some investors. That director, Bonnie Hill, did not immediately return messages left Wednesday for her at her office in __[Los Angeles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles)__ .
Asked in the earlier AP interview if he had thought of hanging up his orange apron and leaving __[Home Depot](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Home_Depot)__ , __[Nardelli](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Nardelli)__  said unequivocally that he hadn't. Asked what he thought he would be doing 10 years from now, Nardelli said, "Selling hammers."
For The __[Home Depot](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Home_Depot)__ ?
"Absolutely," he said at the time.
__[Marcus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bernard_Marcus)__  said he had no idea __[Nardelli](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Nardelli)__ 's resignation was coming.
"Obviously, something happened over this last period of time that changed their mind and __[Nardelli](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Nardelli)__ 's mind about staying," __[Marcus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bernard_Marcus)__  said.
__[Home Depot](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Home_Depot)__  said __[Nardelli](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Nardelli)__ 's decision to resign was by mutual agreement with __[Home Depot](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Home_Depot)__ .
"We are very grateful to __[Bob](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Nardelli)__  for his strong leadership of __[The Home Depot](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Home_Depot)__  over the past six years," Home Depot's board said in a statement.
__[Nardelli](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Nardelli)__  was a nuts-and-bolts leader. He helped increase revenue and profits at __[Home Depot](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Home_Depot)__  and increase the number of stores the company operates. Home Depot's earnings per share have increased by approximately 150 percent over the last five years. But the public discussion about his pay and the company's stock price became a distraction.
As of the end of 2005, __[Nardelli](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Nardelli)__  had earned $123.7 million in compensation excluding certain stock option grants since becoming CEO. His compensation for 2006 has not yet been disclosed.
Industry experts and analysts said his departure and __[Blake](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frank_Blake)__ 's ascent to the top job are a good thing for Home Depot.
"This is not about strategy or vision," said __[James Senn](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/None)__ , director of Robinson College's Center for Global Business Leadership at __[Georgia State University](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georgia_State_University)__ . "This is coming down to two things. Really the foundation of leadership is credibility. __[Bob](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Nardelli)__  has run into some problems there. The second is execution."

Health insurance bridges gap for poor families
Free medical care can help children get out of poverty, official says
__[BIRMINGHAM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Birmingham,_Alabama)__ , __[Ala.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alabama)__  - For years, __[Al Rohling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/None)__  watched parents quit their jobs when their kids got sick, deliberately making their incomes drop to a point where they could get __[U.S. government](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_government_of_the_United_States)__  medical help.
__[Rohling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/None)__ , who directed __[Alabama](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alabama)__ 's housing authority at the time, reached a startling conclusion: If children could drive parents into hardship when they became ill, could medical insurance help parents rediscover financial health?
"Health care for children really is a bridge to get out of poverty," said __[Rohling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/None)__ .
__[Rohling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/None)__  quit his job in 1988 to help set up the __[Child Caring Foundation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/None)__ , which provides free health insurance for children through the __[Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Alabama](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blue_Cross_and_Blue_Shield_of_Alabama)__  health care provider.
The foundation is just one example of a charity that bridges the gap between __[Medicaid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicaid)__  — subsidized insurance — for the poorest and private health insurance paid for either privately for those who can afford it, or by an employer.
That gap leaves up to 9 million __[U.S.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States)__  children uninsured in the __[United States](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States)__ , a nation with no universal health care. Many parents are forced to struggle with a patchwork of other provisions in order to get health care for their children.
"The problem of the uninsured is getting worse," and the number of uninsured children has risen since 2004, said __[Jennifer Tolbert](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/None)__ , principal analyst with the Kaiser Commission on Medicaid and the Uninsured, a __[Washington](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington,_D.C.)__ -based think tank.
__[Tolbert](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/None)__  said it was possible the __[U.S. Congress](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Congress)__  could increase the scope of the __[State Children's Health Insurance Program](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_Children's_Health_Insurance_Program)__  (__[SCHIP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_Children's_Health_Insurance_Program)__ ) to provide greater state coverage for uninsured children when it debates reauthorizing the program next year.
In the lurch
Children with health insurance are usually taken to the doctor at the first sign of illness, while parents of uninsured kids often wait because they are conscious of the cost.
Then the child's illness can worsen and the parent is forced to miss work to nurse the child back to health.
In __[Alabama](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alabama)__ , there were 230,000 uninsured children in 1988, and that has fallen to around 70,000 due to a combination of the __[Child Caring Foundation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/None)__  and state programs.
__[Jody Sharp](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/None)__ , 60, is an example of the problem the charity aims to address.
She and her husband adopted a foster child, Dana, from a mother who was mentally handicapped. Later, they adopted Dana's brother Kyle who has epilepsy and asthma.
But __[Sharp](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/None)__ 's husband, the family wage earner, walked out in 1990, leaving __[Sharp](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/None)__  to bring up the two children with no health insurance.
"If you never had a child with epilepsy, you would never know how many bills you can incur. With no insurance, it's thousands of dollars just like that," __[Sharp](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/None)__  told __[Reuters](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reuters)__ .
During their two years in the __[Alabama Blue Cross Blue Shield](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blue_Cross_and_Blue_Shield_of_Alabama)__  program, __[Sharp](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/None)__ 's children received free medical care and she found a job working with special needs children. The money saved helped her move into private health insurance.
Some 90 percent of the 55,000 children on the program move into private health insurance within about 30 months.
"All of us have times when we lose jobs or lose our homes. You need the support of insurance so you don't have to worry about squeezing doctor bills out of an already stretched paycheck," said __[Sharp](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/None)__ .
Bear's eye
To recruit families, __[Rohling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/None)__  tours the state presenting health screenings at schools with the help of volunteers from the __[University of Alabama at Birmingham](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Alabama_at_Birmingham)__  __[School of Nursing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nursing_school)__  and elsewhere.
At one recent presentation, a student nurse pulled a teddy bear eye out of a child's ear, ending three years of one-sided deafness. It was an example of how problems can fester for children who don't have health insurance.
Low cost health insurance for low income American children began in __[Pittsburgh](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pittsburgh)__  in 1985 when __[Highmark Blue Cross Blue Shield](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Highmark)__  of __[Western Pennsylvania](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Pennsylvania)__  insured children of laid-off steel workers. By 2006, 144,000 children were in their program.
"There was a crisis. And the whole thing came about as an answer for how health insurance should work," said spokesperson __[Denise Grabner](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/None)__  of __[Highmark](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Highmark)__ .
In 1997, the program expanded to include children of the working poor when __[Congress](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Congress)__  enacted the __[SCHIP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_Children's_Health_Insurance_Program)__  providing some matching funding.
__[Alabama](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alabama)__  was the first of 20 states to participate, creating the __[All Kids](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/None)__  program, with money from state settlement with tobacco companies. The program provides insurance for children above the level at which they would qualify for __[Medicaid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicaid)__ .
Many states now provide insurance for families who earn up to double the poverty rate, defined as $10,000 a year for a single person and $20,000 for a family of four. But __[Rohling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/None)__

__[Muslim](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muslim)__  with __[U.S.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States)__  family is held, turned away
Authorities detain businessman of __[Syrian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syrian_people)__  descent for four days in __[Las Vegas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Las_Vegas)__ 
__[FRESNO](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fresno,_California)__ , __[Calif.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California)__  - A German businessman of __[Syrian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syrian_people)__  descent who wanted to surprise his daughter with a holiday visit was detained for four days in a __[Las Vegas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Las_Vegas)__  holding cell before being sent back home without explanation.
A civil rights group called the __[U.S.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States)__  authorities' treatment of __[Majed Shehadeh](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/None)__  a case of anti-Muslim discrimination.
__[Shehadeh](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/None)__ , 62, flew from __[Frankfurt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frankfurt)__  to __[Las Vegas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Las_Vegas)__  last Thursday, hoping to meet with his wife and drive to __[Bakersfield](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bakersfield,_California)__ , __[California](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California)__ , where his American-born daughter had just gotten news she had passed the __[California](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California)__  bar exam. Instead, he wound up shivering in a holding cell without ever being told why he couldn't enter the country, he said.
__[Roxanne Hercules](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/None)__ , a spokeswoman for __[U.S. Customs and Border Protection](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U.S._Customs_and_Border_Protection)__ , confirmed Tuesday that __[Shehadeh](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/None)__  was denied entry, but would not discuss specifics of his case. She said __[Shehadeh](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/None)__ 's visa waiver could have been denied because "he could have a criminal record, or it could be a terrorism issue."
The detention follows a series of similar incidents involving Muslim passengers, according to the __[Council on American-Islamic Relations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Council_on_American–Islamic_Relations)__ .
In October, an __[Islamic scholar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ulama)__  from __[South Africa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Africa)__  was denied entry at __[San Francisco International Airport](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Francisco_International_Airport)__ . A month later, six imams were taken off a __[US Airways](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/US_Airways)__  flight from __[Minneapolis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minneapolis)__  to __[Phoenix](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phoenix,_Arizona)__  after a passenger reported overhearing them criticize the __[U.S. war](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_military_casualties_of_war)__  in __[Iraq](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iraq)__ .
"Overall these cases send a message that Muslims are second-class citizens who can be detained and kept from their families," said __[Affad Shaikh](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/None)__ , a civil rights coordinator for __[CAIR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Council_on_American–Islamic_Relations)__ .
'Nobody ever informed me why'
__[Shehadeh](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/None)__  touched down Thursday afternoon on a direct __[Condor Airlines](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Condor_Flugdienst)__  flight to __[McCarran International Airport](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/McCarran_International_Airport)__ , where his American wife was waiting to pick him up. The couple had planned to visit family in the __[Las Vegas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Las_Vegas)__  area, before surprising their daughter for the __[New Year](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Year)__  and celebrating her wedding anniversary in __[Central California](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_California)__ .
"I gave them my German passport, and he looked to see which countries I visited. He found I had stamps that looked like Arabic and asked if they were fake," __[Shehadeh](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/None)__  said Tuesday in a phone interview from his home in __[Alzenau](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alzenau)__ , a small Bavarian village.
"Nobody ever informed me why I was being questioned," he said. "All that was ever told to me was this had to do with __[Washington](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_government_of_the_United_States)__ ."
After being interrogated by __[Border Protection](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/None)__  and __[FBI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Bureau_of_Investigation)__  agents for more than 12 hours at the airport, __[Shehadeh](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/None)__  said he was handcuffed and transported in the back of police car to a __[North Las Vegas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Las_Vegas,_Nevada)__  jail. Officials told family members they had denied __[Shehadeh](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/None)__ 's visa waiver, which grants German citizens the right to enter the __[U.S.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States)__  with no additional paperwork, said his wife __[Joanne Mulligan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/None)__ .
Officials with __[U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U.S._Immigration_and_Customs_Enforcement)__  said they could not comment on why he was denied entry. __[FBI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Bureau_of_Investigation)__  and airport officials in __[Las Vegas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Las_Vegas)__  also declined comment.
'Never even had a speeding ticket'
An aide to Sen. Dianne Feinstein later told the family that __[Shehadeh](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/None)__  was on a "look-out list," Mulligan said. Feinstein's office confirmed Tuesday that the family contacted her, but wouldn't comment further.
"I said you've got to be joking me, he's never even had a speeding ticket," said Mulligan, a retired math teacher for the U.S. military. "I mean, we're Muslims, and we travel a lot. Maybe the countries we travel to are not the countries they want you to visit."
Once in the holding facility, __[Shehadeh](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/None)__  said he was stripped of his shoes, jacket and prescribed heart medicine and locked in a cell with about 25 other detainees. There was one toilet in the middle of the room, and access to a telephone was extremely limited, he said.
On Sunday, he was released and sent back to Frankfurt on the same charter airline.

__[U.S.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States)__  mines still not safe enough, experts say
One year after __[Sago Mine accident](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sago_Mine_disaster)__ , safety laws still need improving
__[BUCKHANNON](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buckhannon,_West_Virginia)__ , __[W. Va](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_Virginia)__ . - One year ago Tuesday, the nation was holding its breath for 13 miners who were trapped deep inside the __[Sago Mine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sago_Mine_disaster)__  near __[Buckhannon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buckhannon,_West_Virginia)__ , __[W. Va](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_Virginia)__ .
As it turned out, 12 of the 13 miners never made it out alive.
In __[West Virginia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_Virginia)__  Tuesday, __[Randal McCloy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sago_Mine_disaster)__ , the lone survivor of the disaster, joined the families of the 12 men who died — to remember them and the nightmare that began one year ago.
"I'm just sick when I think — every day when I think how those men had to die and it makes me sick," says __[Debbie Hamner](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/None)__  whose husband died in the mine.
Since __[Sago](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sago_Mine_disaster)__ , both __[West Virginia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_Virginia)__  and the federal government have passed new mine safety laws. But in the mines themselves, little has changed.
  • There's still no better way to communicate with miners below ground;
  • Wireless communications won't be required until 2009;
  • Electronic tracking systems for miners are still on the drawing board;
  • Underground emergency safe rooms are still not required by law; and
  • Mines have another year to position more rescue teams.
__[Davitt McAteer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/None)__  is a mine safety expert who once ran the government's __[Mine Safety and Health Administration](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mine_Safety_and_Health_Administration)__  and led __[West Virginia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_Virginia)__ 's __[Sago Mine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sago_Mine_disaster)__  investigation.
"We need to have a way to communicate with trapped miners," __[McAteer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/None)__  says. "We need to protect trapped miners until we can get to them, and we need to have a way that we can provide them with the breathing apparatus and the air system so they can stay alive."
What has changed in mine safety since the __[Sago](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sago_Mine_disaster)__  tragedy:
  • Improved emergency procedures and training is now required;
  • There are more federal mine inspectors and tougher fines for safety violations; and
  • Mines must now notify the federal government within 15 minutes of an accident.
Still not required, though are underground emergency safe rooms.
The union representing many of the nation's 73,000 coal miners says it's a sign of priorities.
"There's still just an attitude out there that production comes first and safety is a convenient thing and it comes second," says __[Dennis O'Dell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/None)__  of __[United Mine Workers of America](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Mine_Workers)__
